3
00:00:39,001 --> 00:00:40,001
Good night, brother.

4
00:00:40,084 --> 00:00:52,083
[door closing].

5
00:00:52,900 --> 00:01:10,000

[door opening]

8
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:26,030
They had to switch up
your food because they

9
00:01:26,072 --> 00:01:28,001
didn't know you were going to McDonald's.

10
00:01:28,001 --> 00:01:31,000
So they're getting you some food
from McDonald's. That's all right?

11
00:01:31,001 --> 00:01:32,000
All right. What are you getting?

12
00:01:32,001 --> 00:01:35,000
Big Macs, Quarter Pounder,
they're getting a bunch of stuff.

13
00:01:35,001 --> 00:01:36,001
And fries and stuff.

14
00:01:36,002 --> 00:01:37,001
I'm getting fish sandwich.

15
00:01:37,002 --> 00:01:38,000
Fish sandwich?

16
00:01:38,001 --> 00:01:39,000
Yeah, fish fillet.

17
00:01:39,001 --> 00:01:40,000
Okay.

18
00:01:40,001 --> 00:01:41,000
Yeah.

19
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:42,000
Let me tell you real quick.

20
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm going to have somebody
show you some photos.

21
00:01:44,001 --> 00:01:45,959
And see if you can remember
the other person that

22
00:01:46,002 --> 00:01:48,001
was there at the time when
the incident happened.

23
00:01:48,001 --> 00:01:49,000
All right?

24
00:01:49,001 --> 00:01:50,000
Okay.

25
00:01:50,001 --> 00:01:51,001
Give me two minutes.

26
00:01:51,002 --> 00:01:52,352
I can make you fish fillet.

27
00:01:52,435 --> 00:01:53,433
All right.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000

29
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:09,000
[silence]

00:02:09,001 --> 00:02:10,000

31
00:02:10,001 --> 00:02:30,000

[door opening]

45
00:04:24,001 --> 00:04:25,000
Good afternoon.

46
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:26,000
How you doing?

47
00:04:26,001 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm good.

48
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:28,000
You look good.

49
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:29,000
My name is Detective Tate.

50
00:04:29,001 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm here on behalf of Detective Talley.

51
00:04:31,001 --> 00:04:32,815
He spoke with you already
in reference to the

52
00:04:32,857 --> 00:04:35,001
photographic reprocess
you're about to take part in.

53
00:04:35,001 --> 00:04:36,000
Yeah.

54
00:04:36,001 --> 00:04:37,000
Okay.

55
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:40,000
Having said that, I'm going to read
some instructions to you, okay?

56
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:43,000
At any point in time, during the course
of me reading these instructions to you,

57
00:04:43,001 --> 00:04:45,000
if you don't understand, you
have a question, let me know.

58
00:04:45,001 --> 00:04:46,000
I'll stop.

59
00:04:46,001 --> 00:04:48,651
I'll explain it to you, and
we'll move forward, okay?

60
00:04:48,734 --> 00:04:49,000
Okay.

61
00:04:49,001 --> 00:04:50,000
All right.

62
00:04:50,001 --> 00:04:52,000
Um, excuse me.

63
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:57,000
As part of the ongoing investigation into
the crime that occurred on June 18, 2022,

64
00:04:57,001 --> 00:04:59,236
in the 3800 block of
Derby Manor Road, you'll

65
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:01,252
be shown a series of photographs, okay?

66
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:02,000
Mm-hmm.

67
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:05,000
I am not involved in this investigation
other than showing these photographs,

68
00:05:05,001 --> 00:05:07,000
and I do not know the
identity of the suspect, okay?

69
00:05:07,001 --> 00:05:08,000
Mm-hmm.

70
00:05:08,001 --> 00:05:09,444
The person who committed
the crime may or may not

71
00:05:09,486 --> 00:05:11,001
be in the set of photographs
you're about to view.

72
00:05:11,001 --> 00:05:12,001
You understand that?

73
00:05:12,084 --> 00:05:13,000
Yes.

74
00:05:13,001 --> 00:05:15,120
The individuals you view
may not appear exactly

75
00:05:15,162 --> 00:05:17,001
as they did on the date of the incident.

76
00:05:17,001 --> 00:05:20,151
Features such as head, facial
hair are subject to change, okay?

77
00:05:20,234 --> 00:05:21,000
Yes.

78
00:05:21,001 --> 00:05:23,000
Photographs may not always depict
the true complexion of a person

79
00:05:23,001 --> 00:05:25,000
and may be lighter or darker
than shown in the photo, okay?

80
00:05:25,001 --> 00:05:26,000
Yes.

81
00:05:26,001 --> 00:05:30,152
Pay no attention to any markings and/or
color defects that may appear on the photos

82
00:05:30,234 --> 00:05:34,000
and any other difference in the
type or style of photographs, okay?

83
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,000
Yes.

84
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,000
You must look at all photographs
contained in this file, okay?

85
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:38,000
Yes.

86
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,249
After you have the opportunity
to view the photographs,

87
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:42,001
I would ask you to follow
on three questions.

88
00:05:42,001 --> 00:05:44,000
One, do you recognize anyone?

89
00:05:44,001 --> 00:05:46,000
Two, if you do, what number
of persons do you recognize?

90
00:05:46,001 --> 00:05:49,000
And third, what role or opinion does the
person play in this investigation, okay?

91
00:05:49,001 --> 00:05:50,000
Okay.

92
00:05:50,001 --> 00:05:52,829
Do not discuss with any
other witnesses what

93
00:05:52,871 --> 00:05:56,001
you see, say, or do during
this procedure, okay?

94
00:05:56,001 --> 00:05:57,000
Yes.

95
00:05:57,001 --> 00:05:59,000
And regardless of whether
or not you select someone,

96
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:02,000
the Baltimore City Police Department will
continue to investigate this incident.

97
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:04,000
Do you understand what I read to you?

98
00:06:04,001 --> 00:06:05,000
Yes.

99
00:06:05,001 --> 00:06:06,651
Do you have any questions for me?

100
00:06:06,734 --> 00:06:07,000
No.

101
00:06:07,001 --> 00:06:08,000
Okay.

102
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:09,991
If you understand what I read to
you, what I need you to do for

103
00:06:10,034 --> 00:06:12,001
me is place an initial
on each one of those

104
00:06:12,001 --> 00:06:14,000
lines going down, initial date and time.

105
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:37,000
[Pause]

106
00:06:37,001 --> 00:06:39,000
Oh, yeah.

107
00:06:39,001 --> 00:06:41,000
Today is 2/14/2013.

108
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:45,000
The time is currently 1:45.

109
00:06:45,001 --> 00:06:46,000
Okay.

110
00:06:46,001 --> 00:06:50,000
[Pause]

111
00:06:50,001 --> 00:06:52,000
All right. Ms. Burrows, when
you're ready, you can open that up.

112
00:06:52,001 --> 00:07:21,000
[Pause]

113
00:07:21,001 --> 00:07:50,000
[Pause]

114
00:07:50,001 --> 00:07:53,701
At this time, have you had the opportunity
to look at all six photographs?

115
00:07:53,784 --> 00:07:54,000
Yes.

116
00:07:54,001 --> 00:07:55,000
Do you need to review
the photographs again?

117
00:07:55,001 --> 00:07:56,000
No.

118
00:07:56,001 --> 00:07:58,000
Okay. Do you recognize anybody?

119
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,000
No, not really. I'm missing one.

120
00:08:01,001 --> 00:08:02,770
Well, you can't look at
them separately, so what

121
00:08:02,813 --> 00:08:05,001
I'm going to do is, if you
want, I can reissue them again.

122
00:08:05,001 --> 00:08:07,000
You can take your time to look at them.
Take your time. No rush.

123
00:08:07,001 --> 00:08:08,501
And we'll go from there, okay?

124
00:08:08,584 --> 00:08:09,000
Okay.

125
00:08:09,001 --> 00:08:38,000
[Pause]

126
00:08:38,001 --> 00:08:54,000
[Pause]

127
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:57,000
Okay. And again, have you had the
opportunity to view all six photographs?

128
00:08:57,001 --> 00:08:58,000
Yeah.

129
00:08:58,001 --> 00:08:59,251
Do you recognize anybody?

130
00:08:59,334 --> 00:09:00,000
No.

131
00:09:00,001 --> 00:09:02,000
All right. At this time, stand by
at the Technical Aid magazine, okay?

132
00:09:02,001 --> 00:09:03,000
All right.

133
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:31,000
[Pause]

134
00:09:31,050 --> 00:10:00,000
[Pause]

135
00:10:00,001 --> 00:10:29,000
[Pause]

136
00:10:29,001 --> 00:10:58,000
[Pause]

137
00:10:58,001 --> 00:11:27,000
[Pause]

138
00:11:27,001 --> 00:11:44,000
[Pause]

139
00:11:44,001 --> 00:12:12,000
[Pause]

140
00:12:12,001 --> 00:12:15,549
All right, London.
Your food is on the way, and we have some

141
00:12:15,591 --> 00:12:19,001
other people from ATF who want
to talk to you, all right?

142
00:12:19,001 --> 00:12:20,000
All right.

143
00:12:20,001 --> 00:12:21,000
Hey, I'm Dawn.

144
00:12:21,001 --> 00:12:22,000
How are you, Dawn?

145
00:12:22,001 --> 00:12:23,000
I'm from ATF.

146
00:12:23,001 --> 00:12:24,000
Yeah.

147
00:12:24,001 --> 00:12:25,001
This is Ted and Dan.

148
00:12:25,084 --> 00:12:26,000
How are you?

149
00:12:26,001 --> 00:12:27,000
Good.

150
00:12:27,001 --> 00:12:28,000
Yeah, you good?

151
00:12:28,001 --> 00:12:29,000
Yeah.

152
00:12:29,001 --> 00:12:30,000
Thanks.

153
00:12:30,001 --> 00:12:33,279
I'm not here to talk to
you about the shooting

154
00:12:33,321 --> 00:12:37,001
that you're in here for.
Do you know what ATF does?

155
00:12:37,001 --> 00:12:41,204
We're basically FBI's better
brother where we handle

156
00:12:41,246 --> 00:12:45,001
violent crime, firearms,
firearms trafficking,

157
00:12:45,001 --> 00:12:50,000
arsenic explosives is another group, but
we're basically mostly violent crime.

158
00:12:50,001 --> 00:12:51,000
Oh, wow.

159
00:12:51,001 --> 00:12:54,026
So during the last time
that you sat down with

160
00:12:54,068 --> 00:12:57,001
Tally and Jeff Naylor,
the state's attorney,

161
00:12:57,001 --> 00:13:01,000
you had talked about the gun
that you had in your possession.

162
00:13:01,001 --> 00:13:02,000
I'm a lawyer.

163
00:13:02,001 --> 00:13:03,000
Oh, oh, sorry.

164
00:13:03,001 --> 00:13:06,000
I'm making sure nothing is-- Hold on.

165
00:13:06,001 --> 00:13:07,000
All right.

166
00:13:07,001 --> 00:13:08,000
All right.

167
00:13:08,001 --> 00:13:10,391
When he said, "Oh, I'm going
to go tell her her food's

168
00:13:10,434 --> 00:13:13,001
back," and I heard it, I was
like, "Oh, I missed my cue."

169
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:14,000
Oh, sorry.

170
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:21,000
I just introduced him and was talking
about what ATF does, which is-- Yeah.

171
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:29,000
All right.

172
00:13:29,001 --> 00:13:34,000
Thank you.

173
00:13:34,001 --> 00:13:37,459
So when you were sitting
down with Jeff Naylor before,

174
00:13:37,502 --> 00:13:41,001
you had said that the guns
that they recovered on you,

175
00:13:41,001 --> 00:13:44,000
you had gotten with Devin
and Dion down in Georgia.

176
00:13:44,001 --> 00:13:46,001
Do you remember that whole conversation?

177
00:13:46,084 --> 00:13:47,000
Yeah.

178
00:13:47,001 --> 00:13:53,000
So it piqued our interest about who
it was that was buying guns in Atlanta

179
00:13:53,001 --> 00:13:56,145
and then how they were making
their way to Baltimore because

180
00:13:56,187 --> 00:13:59,001
obviously Baltimore has a
pretty high gun crime rate,

181
00:13:59,001 --> 00:14:03,001
and so we're kind of wondering where all
the gun influx is coming from downtown.

182
00:14:03,084 --> 00:14:07,270
So those are the questions
that I'll be asking,

183
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:11,001
but if you want, we can just go with you,

184
00:14:11,001 --> 00:14:14,000
and then you say, and then if I have any
follow-up questions, I can go from there.

185
00:14:14,001 --> 00:14:15,000
Okay.

186
00:14:15,001 --> 00:14:17,000
What do you think?

187
00:14:17,001 --> 00:14:19,459
First, I don't know
exactly where they come

188
00:14:19,502 --> 00:14:22,001
from down there, but
when I was down there,

189
00:14:22,001 --> 00:14:26,407
like a gun school, they
go to a gun school,

190
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:31,001
and just somebody had
a license to get them,

191
00:14:31,001 --> 00:14:37,000
and they get them, and then they transport
them back through like the Chinese bus,

192
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:41,411
and that's how they get
them back, through the

193
00:14:41,453 --> 00:14:46,001
Chinese bus, because you
don't get searched on.

194
00:14:46,001 --> 00:14:49,000
Yeah, I mean, it's a really good thing
because you put all your luggage below,

195
00:14:49,001 --> 00:14:52,001
and then you're riding, so you don't
really have to own up to any of your stuff.

196
00:14:52,001 --> 00:14:57,000
That time that you went down with them,
just those two, right, Devin and Dion?

197
00:14:57,001 --> 00:14:58,000
Yeah.

198
00:14:58,001 --> 00:15:00,551
Is that the only time that
you went down with them?

199
00:15:00,634 --> 00:15:01,000
Yes.

200
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:05,000
Do you know how many times--so I guess
who is that main person that goes down?

201
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:06,000
Devin.

202
00:15:06,001 --> 00:15:07,000
Devin?

203
00:15:07,001 --> 00:15:08,000
Yeah.

204
00:15:08,001 --> 00:15:10,000
And do you know Devin's last name?

205
00:15:10,167 --> 00:15:11,000
No.

206
00:15:11,001 --> 00:15:13,451
Would you be able to
identify him if you saw him?

207
00:15:13,534 --> 00:15:19,000
Yes.

208
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,000
Who is this person to you?

209
00:15:21,001 --> 00:15:22,000
That's Devin.

210
00:15:22,001 --> 00:15:23,000
That's Devin?

211
00:15:23,001 --> 00:15:24,000
Yeah.

212
00:15:24,001 --> 00:15:31,000
And then do you recognize this person?

213
00:15:31,001 --> 00:15:32,000
Yeah.

214
00:15:32,001 --> 00:15:33,000
Who is that?

215
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,000
Dion.

216
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:35,000
That's Dion?

217
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:36,000
Yeah.

218
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:37,351
Okay, so those two go down.

219
00:15:37,434 --> 00:15:40,000
Does Dion have family down there?

220
00:15:40,001 --> 00:15:42,000
Yeah, he has family down there.

221
00:15:42,001 --> 00:15:43,051
Who lives down there?

222
00:15:43,134 --> 00:15:45,000
His mom.

223
00:15:45,001 --> 00:15:46,051
Do you know her name?

224
00:15:46,134 --> 00:15:47,000
Shelly.

225
00:15:47,001 --> 00:15:49,000
Shelly.

226
00:15:49,001 --> 00:15:51,000
And who else lives down there?

227
00:15:51,001 --> 00:15:52,000
That's my mom.

228
00:15:52,001 --> 00:15:53,000
Okay.

229
00:15:53,001 --> 00:15:55,151
Is Shelly the one that
was buying the guns?

230
00:15:55,234 --> 00:15:56,000
No.

231
00:15:56,001 --> 00:15:57,000
She doesn't know nothing about it.

232
00:15:57,001 --> 00:15:58,000
Oh, she doesn't.

233
00:15:58,001 --> 00:15:59,000
Okay.

234
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:00,000
No.

235
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,000
Who was the person buying the guns?

236
00:16:02,001 --> 00:16:05,000
It was somebody that Dion knew.

237
00:16:05,001 --> 00:16:06,000
Okay.

238
00:16:06,001 --> 00:16:09,000
And I don't know the guy per se.

239
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:13,000
And do you remember what he looked like?

240
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:15,000
I can't.

241
00:16:15,001 --> 00:16:17,000
I mean, he's black.

242
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,000
Blackmailing it, Leanna, got it.

243
00:16:20,001 --> 00:16:23,000
Blackmailing it, blackmailing it.

244
00:16:23,001 --> 00:16:27,051
I don't really know him personally because
I didn't really get introduced to him.

245
00:16:27,134 --> 00:16:28,000
Okay.

246
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:29,417
Do you remember his name?

247
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,000
No.

248
00:16:30,001 --> 00:16:31,000
Okay.

249
00:16:31,001 --> 00:16:34,000
And you only met him that one time?

250
00:16:34,001 --> 00:16:35,000
Yeah.

251
00:16:35,001 --> 00:16:37,000
Do you think if you saw a picture of
him, you'd be able to recognize him?

252
00:16:37,001 --> 00:16:40,913
Not really because I
only did a quick drive

253
00:16:40,956 --> 00:16:45,001
and then, you know,
this, exchange and gone.

254
00:16:46,167 --> 00:16:47,000
So.

255
00:16:47,001 --> 00:16:48,000
All right.

256
00:16:48,001 --> 00:16:49,000
Let's just go through
when you went down there.

257
00:16:49,001 --> 00:16:51,000
You went down there on the Chinese bus.

258
00:16:51,001 --> 00:16:53,301
Did somebody take you
over to the bus station?

259
00:16:53,384 --> 00:16:58,000
We called Uber to the house.

260
00:16:58,001 --> 00:17:00,000
Who paid for that Uber?

261
00:17:00,001 --> 00:17:03,000
I did.

262
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:04,451
And you have an Uber account?

263
00:17:04,534 --> 00:17:09,000
Yes.

264
00:17:09,001 --> 00:17:12,001
And what was the address of the
house that you guys went to?

265
00:17:12,084 --> 00:17:13,000
I don't know.

266
00:17:13,001 --> 00:17:14,000
Okay.

267
00:17:14,001 --> 00:17:15,000
I don't remember.

268
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:16,000
A street name?

269
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:17,000
I don't know.

270
00:17:17,001 --> 00:17:18,000
A street name.

271
00:17:18,001 --> 00:17:19,000
Yeah.

272
00:17:19,001 --> 00:17:21,000
Who gave you the address to the house?

273
00:17:21,001 --> 00:17:24,000
The.

274
00:17:24,175 --> 00:17:26,000
And whose house was it?

275
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:30,000
It was, I think it was his father's house.

276
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,000
I think it was his father's house.

277
00:17:32,001 --> 00:17:34,000
Okay.

278
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:38,000
And who did you meet when you got there?

279
00:17:38,001 --> 00:17:40,000
His father and the kids and stuff.

280
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,000
How many kids?

281
00:17:42,001 --> 00:17:46,000
It was like one, two, five of them.

282
00:17:46,001 --> 00:17:47,551
Do you remember his dad's name?

283
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,000
No.

284
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:50,801
Do you remember what he looked like?

285
00:17:50,884 --> 00:17:53,000
No.

286
00:17:53,001 --> 00:17:55,000
Or how old the kids were?

287
00:17:55,001 --> 00:17:56,000
I don't know.

288
00:17:56,001 --> 00:17:57,051
They were young kids.

289
00:17:57,134 --> 00:17:58,000
Yeah.

290
00:17:58,001 --> 00:18:06,000
I want to say like four of the ten.

291
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:08,033
And was there any females or anybody else

292
00:18:08,076 --> 00:18:10,352
living at the house
besides the dad and kids?

293
00:18:10,434 --> 00:18:11,000
No.

294
00:18:11,001 --> 00:18:12,000
Okay.

295
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,000
No.

296
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:17,651
And would that be his father and then
mother would be Shelly at a different house?

297
00:18:17,733 --> 00:18:18,000
Yeah.

298
00:18:18,001 --> 00:18:19,000
All right.

299
00:18:19,001 --> 00:18:23,000
That house that you guys drove to, is that
like an apartment, a single family home?

300
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:24,000
That just means like one house?

301
00:18:24,001 --> 00:18:25,401
It was a single family home.

302
00:18:25,484 --> 00:18:29,000
Single family.

303
00:18:29,001 --> 00:18:30,000
All right.

304
00:18:30,001 --> 00:18:31,000
And what happened when you guys got there?

305
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:33,000
We went down there.

306
00:18:33,001 --> 00:18:35,000
We chilled for a little bit.

307
00:18:35,001 --> 00:18:38,000
We went out, partied and stuff like that.

308
00:18:38,001 --> 00:18:39,000
And then I left.

309
00:18:39,001 --> 00:18:41,000
I wound up leaving them down there.

310
00:18:41,001 --> 00:18:43,251
And I left and caught
the bus back by myself.

311
00:18:43,334 --> 00:18:46,000
Well, during that time you
guys bought a gun, right?

312
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:47,000
Yeah.

313
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:49,000
So let's say you guys bought a gun.

314
00:18:49,001 --> 00:18:51,000
It was already brought.

315
00:18:51,001 --> 00:18:52,000
Oh, okay.

316
00:18:52,001 --> 00:18:55,000
I just got it from -- And
who did you get it from?

317
00:18:55,075 --> 00:18:57,000
I just got it from Devin Hedges.

318
00:18:57,001 --> 00:18:58,151
I just got it from him.

319
00:18:58,234 --> 00:19:03,000
Oh, okay.

320
00:19:03,001 --> 00:19:06,067
And had Devin gotten it while he was
down there or did he come down with it?

321
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,000
No, he didn't come down with it.

322
00:19:08,001 --> 00:19:13,000
He left and in exchange he got it
from the guy that I told you about.

323
00:19:13,001 --> 00:19:17,000
And then that's when I got it
from him and that was that.

324
00:19:17,925 --> 00:19:19,000
Okay.

325
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:23,000
And I left and came back down
here because I had to go to work.

326
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:27,000
Did Devin leave at some point or
did he meet in the dad's house?

327
00:19:27,001 --> 00:19:32,000
No, when we went out, I want to say
like it was a downtown area down there.

328
00:19:32,001 --> 00:19:35,000
And we met him down there or whatever.

329
00:19:35,001 --> 00:19:37,000
They just called by the Actons.

330
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,000
What is it?

331
00:19:38,001 --> 00:19:39,000
Vine.

332
00:19:39,001 --> 00:19:41,000
The street was called Vine and Actons.

333
00:19:41,001 --> 00:19:42,000
Okay.

334
00:19:42,001 --> 00:19:44,451
So we met down there,
whatever the case might be.

335
00:19:44,534 --> 00:19:49,000
And after that, we went up, we went
out, we just chilled and went out.

336
00:19:49,001 --> 00:19:52,000
And Devin had the gun the whole time
or he gave it to you at that time?

337
00:19:52,001 --> 00:19:54,000
No, he had it the whole time.

338
00:19:54,001 --> 00:19:56,151
And then when I wound
up leaving, I got it.

339
00:19:56,234 --> 00:19:57,000
Okay.

340
00:19:57,001 --> 00:19:59,000
And do you know if any other guns
were exchanged during that time?

341
00:19:59,001 --> 00:20:02,000
No, I don't know about all that.

342
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:05,000
And you only came up with the one gun?

343
00:20:05,001 --> 00:20:06,000
The one I had.

344
00:20:06,001 --> 00:20:07,301
What kind of gun that was?

345
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:11,000
I think it was a nine, I think.

346
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,000
Nine, really no gun like that.

347
00:20:13,001 --> 00:20:14,000
Okay.

348
00:20:14,001 --> 00:20:15,101
That was my first gun.

349
00:20:15,184 --> 00:20:18,000
Is that the gun that you
were later arrested with?

350
00:20:18,001 --> 00:20:19,000
Yes.

351
00:20:19,001 --> 00:20:20,000
You're positive?

352
00:20:20,001 --> 00:20:21,000
Yes.

353
00:20:21,001 --> 00:20:23,000
Okay.

354
00:20:23,001 --> 00:20:25,000
And Devin and Dion stayed down there?

355
00:20:25,001 --> 00:20:26,451
Yeah, they stayed down there.

356
00:20:26,452 --> 00:20:29,652
And you don't know if they came
back at that time with any guns?

357
00:20:29,735 --> 00:20:32,000
No, I don't know.

358
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:37,000
And you only met whoever
it was that gave the

359
00:20:37,001 --> 00:20:39,000
gun on that street and they had exchanged?

360
00:20:39,001 --> 00:20:40,051
Yeah, they exchanged.

361
00:20:40,134 --> 00:20:42,334
Do you know if they
exchanged money as well?

362
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:45,000
No, it was just a bag exchange.

363
00:20:45,001 --> 00:20:48,000
Do you remember how he
passed the guns to him?

364
00:20:48,001 --> 00:20:49,000
In a bag.

365
00:20:49,001 --> 00:20:50,000
In a bag?

366
00:20:50,001 --> 00:20:51,000
Yeah.

367
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,050
Like a double bag?

368
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:55,000
A double bag.

369
00:20:55,001 --> 00:20:57,251
Did they talk like they
had done that before?

370
00:20:57,425 --> 00:20:59,775
No, they just shot it up for him and then

371
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:02,000
boom, that's how the
car was set in the car.

372
00:21:02,001 --> 00:21:05,000
He got in the bag, boom, he
got in the car and we left.

373
00:21:05,001 --> 00:21:06,000
Okay.

374
00:21:06,001 --> 00:21:07,000
Did you see that guy arrive in a car?

375
00:21:07,001 --> 00:21:09,000
Yeah, he was already there.

376
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:11,150
Do you remember what kind of car he had?

377
00:21:11,233 --> 00:21:13,000
I think it was white.

378
00:21:13,001 --> 00:21:15,151
I want to say a white
Honda, I want to say.

379
00:21:15,234 --> 00:21:16,000
Okay.

380
00:21:16,001 --> 00:21:18,000
A white BMW, one of them.

381
00:21:18,001 --> 00:21:20,000
It was white though.

382
00:21:20,001 --> 00:21:23,000
And then how did you come
into possession of that gun?

383
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,150
Like when they got in the
car, did they give it to you?

384
00:21:26,233 --> 00:21:27,000
No, I had it.

385
00:21:27,001 --> 00:21:31,000
When I was ready to leave, when I was
ready to go back, he gave it to me.

386
00:21:31,001 --> 00:21:33,000
He offered it or you asked to buy it?

387
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:35,000
No, I didn't buy it.

388
00:21:35,001 --> 00:21:38,000
I was like, "Cousin, I like
that, let me get that."

389
00:21:38,001 --> 00:21:40,000
He gave it to me.

390
00:21:40,001 --> 00:21:41,000
That's nice of him.

391
00:21:41,001 --> 00:21:43,000
I didn't buy nothing though.

392
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:46,000
Okay.

393
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,000
And then obviously he had other
guns in that double bag if they--

394
00:21:50,001 --> 00:21:52,000
Yeah, I guess, yeah, I think so.

395
00:21:52,001 --> 00:21:53,000
And brought it back up here.

396
00:21:53,001 --> 00:21:55,000
Do you know how many
times that they've gone

397
00:21:55,001 --> 00:21:57,000
down there and then brought guns back up?

398
00:21:57,001 --> 00:22:01,000
They go back and forth
sometimes, for real, for real.

399
00:22:01,001 --> 00:22:05,000
But I know that's how they get
them back on the Chinese bus.

400
00:22:05,175 --> 00:22:08,275
And did they talk any more about
the guy that was buying them?

401
00:22:08,358 --> 00:22:12,000
No, I ain't really discussed him for real.

402
00:22:12,001 --> 00:22:15,701
You said in that last--I'm sure you
forgot because it was like a year ago,

403
00:22:15,784 --> 00:22:21,000
a year prior, but the name
Rashard, do you remember that?

404
00:22:21,001 --> 00:22:22,000
Yeah.

405
00:22:22,001 --> 00:22:23,000
Who was that for?

406
00:22:23,001 --> 00:22:24,000
The father.

407
00:22:24,001 --> 00:22:27,000
But not the same person who
was exchanging the guns?

408
00:22:27,001 --> 00:22:28,000
No.

409
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:33,000
I see.

410
00:22:33,001 --> 00:22:37,000
And you said that Devin and Dion
are usually carrying guns on them?

411
00:22:37,167 --> 00:22:38,000
Yeah.

412
00:22:38,001 --> 00:22:40,000
Do you know who they're selling
to when they get back up here?

413
00:22:40,001 --> 00:22:41,000
Anybody.

414
00:22:41,001 --> 00:22:42,000
Anybody.

415
00:22:42,001 --> 00:22:44,401
Do you know how much
they're making on the guns?

416
00:22:44,484 --> 00:22:48,000
I don't know, probably about $1,000.

417
00:22:48,001 --> 00:22:49,000
Per handgun?

418
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:51,000
Yeah.

419
00:22:51,001 --> 00:22:53,000
That's a pretty good markup.

420
00:22:53,001 --> 00:22:56,000
And do you know where they're getting the
money to originally buy them down south?

421
00:22:56,001 --> 00:23:02,000
I think in profit from what
they make in offer, like a flip.

422
00:23:02,001 --> 00:23:04,151
Yeah, and then they
just deduce the profit.

423
00:23:04,234 --> 00:23:06,000
That's just from what I'm thinking.

424
00:23:06,001 --> 00:23:07,151
Yeah, that makes sense.

425
00:23:07,234 --> 00:23:10,000
Do you know how they
usually exchange money?

426
00:23:10,001 --> 00:23:12,201
Is it like digital like
Venmo or is it cash?

427
00:23:12,284 --> 00:23:14,000
I think it should be cash.

428
00:23:14,001 --> 00:23:15,000
Cash.

429
00:23:15,001 --> 00:23:17,000
I don't think it should be all
no cash happening out of there.

430
00:23:17,001 --> 00:23:18,000
You would think.

431
00:23:18,001 --> 00:23:24,000
Yeah.

432
00:23:24,001 --> 00:23:29,000
And you don't know how many
times they've gone down there?

433
00:23:29,001 --> 00:23:33,000
Do you recognize this person at all?

434
00:23:33,001 --> 00:23:34,251
I don't know who that is.

435
00:23:34,334 --> 00:23:42,000
Okay.

436
00:23:42,001 --> 00:23:45,701
Do you remember what--and I guess you
didn't go to the gun store with him.

437
00:23:45,784 --> 00:23:50,000
That was just a street.

438
00:23:50,175 --> 00:23:52,476
In your phone, the phone
they took from you during

439
00:23:52,518 --> 00:23:55,001
the search warrant that was
cracked and maybe broken,

440
00:23:55,001 --> 00:23:59,000
do you know if any of the
messages or telephone numbers or

441
00:23:59,001 --> 00:24:01,000
anything exchanged, anything
would be important in there?

442
00:24:01,001 --> 00:24:02,000
No.

443
00:24:02,001 --> 00:24:03,351
Nothing important in there?

444
00:24:03,434 --> 00:24:06,433
No, not important in there.

445
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,000
I don't think they were
ever able to get into it,

446
00:24:08,001 --> 00:24:10,000
but I also don't think that
they got a search warrant.

447
00:24:10,001 --> 00:24:13,000
I don't know how you feel
about a consent to search.

448
00:24:13,001 --> 00:24:18,000
I don't actually know that they'd be able
to break it, but I guess it's possible.

449
00:24:18,001 --> 00:24:21,000
It's like a broken phone,
but we can always try.

450
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:23,000
A broken phone.

451
00:24:23,001 --> 00:24:24,000
I think the screen was cracked.

452
00:24:24,001 --> 00:24:26,000
It just didn't turn on correctly.

453
00:24:26,001 --> 00:24:28,000
It just kept flickering on and off.

454
00:24:28,001 --> 00:24:30,000
My phone won't crank.

455
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:32,000
Oh, really?

456
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,000
Maybe it's a different phone.

457
00:24:34,001 --> 00:24:35,000
What kind of phone did
you have when you got it?

458
00:24:35,001 --> 00:24:36,000
An iPhone.

459
00:24:36,001 --> 00:24:38,000
This was an iPhone in a white case.

460
00:24:38,001 --> 00:24:40,000
That's not my phone.

461
00:24:40,001 --> 00:24:49,000
Okay.

462
00:24:49,001 --> 00:24:52,000
I gave them my phone information.

463
00:24:52,001 --> 00:24:53,000
Okay.

464
00:24:53,001 --> 00:24:55,000
They had my phone information.

465
00:24:55,001 --> 00:24:59,000
I mean, it sounds like none
of the information would

466
00:24:59,001 --> 00:25:02,000
be in the phone anyway, so
it's not that big of a deal.

467
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:08,000
The guy that was selling the guns, you
don't know how he's related, do you?

468
00:25:08,001 --> 00:25:10,000
No.

469
00:25:10,001 --> 00:25:11,051
Or if related at all.

470
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:16,000
I don't know.

471
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:18,000
Do you guys have any questions?

472
00:25:18,001 --> 00:25:20,176
Did they ever ask you
about the gun afterwards

473
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:23,000
when you came back to
Baltimore to be honored, Devin?

474
00:25:23,001 --> 00:25:25,000
No, they asked me about nothing.

475
00:25:25,075 --> 00:25:28,325
They never said what happened to
it, even after you got arrested?

476
00:25:28,408 --> 00:25:29,000
No.

477
00:25:29,001 --> 00:25:30,051
I don't talk to none.

478
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:46,000
I don't talk to nobody.

479
00:25:46,001 --> 00:25:51,000
What makes you think that that guy that
Devin and Dion got that gun from is the

480
00:25:51,001 --> 00:25:55,000
same guy that purchased
them, or do you not know?

481
00:25:55,001 --> 00:25:59,000
I say that because from just regular

482
00:25:59,001 --> 00:26:02,000
conversations, we find
that this is us talking.

483
00:26:02,001 --> 00:26:04,000
That's how it was brought up.

484
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,000
That makes sense.

485
00:26:06,001 --> 00:26:09,000
Do you remember if the guns were in boxes?

486
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:11,000
No, they wasn't in boxes.

487
00:26:11,001 --> 00:26:14,000
They was new, though,
but they wasn't in boxes.

488
00:26:14,001 --> 00:26:15,000
You could tell that they were new?

489
00:26:15,001 --> 00:26:16,000
Yeah.

490
00:26:16,001 --> 00:26:23,000
You had mentioned something about
an AR, or like a long rifle.

491
00:26:23,001 --> 00:26:24,000
Do you remember what that was?

492
00:26:24,001 --> 00:26:27,000
I couldn't really understand
on the tape what you had said.

493
00:26:27,001 --> 00:26:28,000
What you mean?

494
00:26:28,001 --> 00:26:31,000
You said that they bring handguns, and one

495
00:26:31,001 --> 00:26:32,000
time you knew that they
had brought a rifle up.

496
00:26:32,001 --> 00:26:33,000
Yeah.

497
00:26:33,001 --> 00:26:34,301
Was that during that trip?

498
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:39,000
Not the trip that I was on, but
prior to when they came back,

499
00:26:39,001 --> 00:26:46,000
we was chilling one night
over at Nardi House, and they

500
00:26:46,001 --> 00:26:48,051
showed me it, or whatever,
and they just got rid of it.

501
00:26:48,052 --> 00:26:49,302
They sold it to somebody.

502
00:26:49,385 --> 00:26:50,000
I see.

503
00:26:50,001 --> 00:26:53,000
Do you know any actual
person that they sold it to?

504
00:26:53,001 --> 00:26:54,000
No.

505
00:26:54,001 --> 00:26:55,000
I don't really know the people.

506
00:26:55,001 --> 00:26:56,401
They just sold it to people.

507
00:26:56,484 --> 00:26:57,000
Okay.

508
00:26:57,001 --> 00:26:59,000
I asked people that they knew.

509
00:26:59,001 --> 00:27:00,151
Yeah, that makes sense.

510
00:27:00,234 --> 00:27:02,000
I don't know.

511
00:27:02,001 --> 00:27:05,000
Do you remember that
night, the date of that

512
00:27:05,001 --> 00:27:06,000
night that you were hanging
out that they sold it?

513
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:07,000
No.

514
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:09,000
I just moved here.

515
00:27:09,001 --> 00:27:12,000
I don't remember.

516
00:27:12,001 --> 00:27:15,000
But you think that that
AR came from Georgia?

517
00:27:15,001 --> 00:27:18,000
Yeah.

518
00:27:18,001 --> 00:27:21,000
I ain't going to go to that on here.

519
00:27:21,001 --> 00:27:24,000
Yeah, Maryland's pretty
tough to get a gun from.

520
00:27:24,001 --> 00:27:26,000
Yeah.

521
00:27:26,001 --> 00:27:31,000
Were you ever there
during a sale of a gun?

522
00:27:31,001 --> 00:27:33,000
What do you mean?

523
00:27:33,001 --> 00:27:38,000
Like were you ever present watching Deon
or Devin sell the gun to somebody else?

524
00:27:38,001 --> 00:27:39,000
No.

525
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,000
Only that day I saw them
give it to somebody.

526
00:27:41,001 --> 00:27:42,000
The AR?

527
00:27:42,001 --> 00:27:43,000
Yeah.

528
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:45,000
And do you remember what
month that was maybe?

529
00:27:45,001 --> 00:27:47,000
I don't know what month.

530
00:27:47,001 --> 00:27:49,000
I think you were arrested in June.

531
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:54,000
You thought that maybe in May
was when you had gone down there?

532
00:27:54,001 --> 00:27:57,000
Yeah, I went down there sometime.

533
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:59,000
I don't even remember for real.

534
00:27:59,001 --> 00:28:02,000
I arrested, but it was
like, I don't want to

535
00:28:02,001 --> 00:28:05,000
say like, I'm trying to
think of the weather.

536
00:28:05,025 --> 00:28:09,000
You said it had been nice down there,
so they were thinking like maybe spring.

537
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,150
I don't want to say, probably spring
because it wasn't cold or nothing.

538
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:16,000
So probably spring.

539
00:28:16,001 --> 00:28:17,000
All right.

540
00:28:17,001 --> 00:28:21,000
And then the AR thing, did that happen
before that time that you went down?

541
00:28:21,001 --> 00:28:23,000
No, it hadn't happened.

542
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:24,000
Okay.

543
00:28:24,001 --> 00:28:25,000
I had gone down.

544
00:28:25,001 --> 00:28:27,000
So between May and June?

545
00:28:27,001 --> 00:28:28,000
Yeah, probably.

546
00:28:28,001 --> 00:28:29,000
Yeah.

547
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:39,000
And you don't remember
who they had sold to?

548
00:28:39,001 --> 00:28:41,000
Did somebody come to the house?

549
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,033
No.

550
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:44,000
No, we was out.

551
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,000
We was out somewhere.

552
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,000
I ain't come to no house.

553
00:28:50,001 --> 00:28:51,000
Okay.

554
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Nothing.

555
00:28:53,025 --> 00:28:55,275
Did you say before you
were at Noddy's house?

556
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:56,000
Yeah.

557
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,000
Who's Noddy?

558
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:59,000
My homeboy.

559
00:28:59,001 --> 00:29:01,000
You got out first last night?

560
00:29:01,001 --> 00:29:03,000
No, I don't know.

561
00:29:03,001 --> 00:29:04,051
It just called Noddy.

562
00:29:04,134 --> 00:29:05,000
I got you.

563
00:29:05,001 --> 00:29:06,101
Where's that house at?

564
00:29:06,184 --> 00:29:09,000
Like over east, Erdman.

565
00:29:09,001 --> 00:29:10,000
Erdman?

566
00:29:10,001 --> 00:29:11,000
Yeah.

567
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,000
You know like, what part of Erdman?

568
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:16,000
I don't know the address of the apartment.

569
00:29:16,001 --> 00:29:17,000
The host apartment?

570
00:29:17,001 --> 00:29:18,000
Yeah.

571
00:29:18,001 --> 00:29:21,000
Okay.

572
00:29:21,001 --> 00:29:22,751
You remember what they looked like?

573
00:29:22,834 --> 00:29:26,000
Was it like low rises, high
rises, like garden style?

574
00:29:26,001 --> 00:29:28,000
Was it like a big tall building?

575
00:29:28,001 --> 00:29:29,000
Were they small?

576
00:29:29,001 --> 00:29:33,000
I mean, it was like the apartments.

577
00:29:33,167 --> 00:29:34,000
Okay.

578
00:29:34,001 --> 00:29:37,000
Yeah, it was like the apartments.

579
00:29:37,001 --> 00:29:40,000
During any type of exchange
or even through talk,

580
00:29:40,001 --> 00:29:45,000
do you think it was more Devin running
the show or Dion running the show?

581
00:29:45,001 --> 00:29:48,000
I think it was more
Devin running the show.

582
00:29:48,001 --> 00:29:51,201
And I guess Dion would be the
connect if it was down in Atlanta.

583
00:29:51,284 --> 00:29:53,000
Isn't that where his family lives?

584
00:29:53,001 --> 00:29:54,000
Yeah.

585
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:59,000
I guess Dion set it up and then
Devin would get people up here.

586
00:29:59,001 --> 00:30:01,151
And do you know who
would handle the money?

587
00:30:01,234 --> 00:30:03,000
No, I don't know what I like.

588
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:05,000
Okay.

589
00:30:05,001 --> 00:30:07,000
Do you know if they're locked up?

590
00:30:07,001 --> 00:30:09,000
I don't know.

591
00:30:09,001 --> 00:30:13,000
Do you think that they would
still-- I don't talk to anyone.

592
00:30:13,001 --> 00:30:15,000
I've been locked up.

593
00:30:15,001 --> 00:30:17,000
I only speak to my family.

594
00:30:17,001 --> 00:30:19,000
That's good.

595
00:30:19,001 --> 00:30:21,000
All right.

596
00:30:21,001 --> 00:30:23,251
Can you think of anything
else that I missed?

597
00:30:23,334 --> 00:30:25,000
No, you got anything?

598
00:30:25,001 --> 00:30:31,000
When you said the gun license, do you
know if that's like a license to carry

599
00:30:31,001 --> 00:30:34,000
or just that they can easily
purchase guns down there?

600
00:30:34,001 --> 00:30:37,000
I mean, if you got a gun
license, what is it for?

601
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:40,000
So different states have
different requirements.

602
00:30:40,075 --> 00:30:45,000
So like in Maryland, sometimes you
have to have like a handgun license

603
00:30:45,001 --> 00:30:50,000
to be able to purchase, you know,
or you can circumvent the system.

604
00:30:50,001 --> 00:30:54,000
But sometimes if you have a handgun license
down in Georgia, you can just show that

605
00:30:54,001 --> 00:30:56,000
and then you don't have to go
through different backgrounds.

606
00:30:56,001 --> 00:31:01,000
I'm pretty sure if you got a handgun
license, then you can purchase a gun, right?

607
00:31:01,001 --> 00:31:03,000
Right.

608
00:31:03,001 --> 00:31:05,000
Usually.

609
00:31:05,001 --> 00:31:07,351
But you never saw them
actually have a license.

610
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:10,000
No, I don't know about that.

611
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:12,000
Okay.

612
00:31:12,001 --> 00:31:14,000
I can't think of anything else.

613
00:31:14,001 --> 00:31:19,000
They were messed with like ghost
guns or P-80s or plastic guns.

614
00:31:19,001 --> 00:31:21,000
I don't know about all that.

615
00:31:21,001 --> 00:31:23,000
I don't know about guns.

616
00:31:23,001 --> 00:31:25,000
That was my first gun.

617
00:31:25,001 --> 00:31:27,201
I don't even play around
with them for real.

618
00:31:27,284 --> 00:31:29,000
It was just for protection.

619
00:31:29,001 --> 00:31:31,000
Okay.

620
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:33,000
Yeah.

621
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:35,300
All right, I think that's all I have.

622
00:31:35,383 --> 00:31:37,000
[knocking]

623
00:31:37,001 --> 00:31:39,000
[inaudible]

624
00:31:39,001 --> 00:31:41,000
He's been relaxing.

625
00:31:41,001 --> 00:31:43,000
[laughter]

626
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:45,000
[inaudible]

627
00:31:45,001 --> 00:31:47,000
[inaudible]

628
00:31:47,001 --> 00:31:49,000
[inaudible]

629
00:31:49,001 --> 00:31:51,000
[laughter]

630
00:31:51,001 --> 00:31:53,000
[inaudible]

631
00:31:53,001 --> 00:31:55,000
[inaudible]

632
00:31:55,001 --> 00:31:57,000
[inaudible]

633
00:31:57,001 --> 00:31:59,000
[inaudible]

634
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:01,000
Is it pretty rough tonight?

635
00:32:01,001 --> 00:32:03,000
Not really.

636
00:32:03,001 --> 00:32:06,000
I've been like that before.

637
00:32:06,001 --> 00:32:08,000
So you know the system all of it?

638
00:32:08,001 --> 00:32:12,000
I'm patient with it, yeah.

639
00:32:12,001 --> 00:32:15,000
Well, I know how healthy you've been after

640
00:32:15,001 --> 00:32:18,000
this, and so hopefully
they see that, you know?

641
00:32:18,001 --> 00:32:23,000
And especially I was listening to your
part of what -- the shooting situation,

642
00:32:23,001 --> 00:32:28,000
so hopefully they understand that
that was not fully your deal.

643
00:32:28,001 --> 00:32:30,000
It wasn't at all.

644
00:32:30,001 --> 00:32:44,000
[silence]

645
00:32:44,001 --> 00:32:46,601
Do you want me to watch
your eyes with the intercom?

646
00:32:46,684 --> 00:32:50,000
No, you will not.

647
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:52,000
Sometimes the text
messages don't go through.

648
00:32:52,001 --> 00:32:54,000
That's why I ended up calling back.

649
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:58,000
I was like -- because
I thought it was being

650
00:32:58,001 --> 00:33:00,000
delivered on my end, but
it wasn't being read.

651
00:33:00,001 --> 00:33:01,201
He just responded, okay.

652
00:33:01,284 --> 00:33:03,000
Okay.

653
00:33:03,001 --> 00:33:06,000
[inaudible]

654
00:33:06,001 --> 00:33:08,000
All right, we'll go back in there.

655
00:33:08,001 --> 00:33:10,185
And if you can think
of anything else as far

656
00:33:10,227 --> 00:33:14,000
as gun trafficking or guns or violence
goes, we're always interested.

657
00:33:14,001 --> 00:33:15,000
I will.

658
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:17,250
Get in touch with your defense attorney.

659
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:18,000
Okay.

660
00:33:18,001 --> 00:33:20,000
Just letting you know
if you have some more

661
00:33:20,001 --> 00:33:22,101
information, are you remembered
or, you know, anything.

662
00:33:22,184 --> 00:33:23,000
Okay.

663
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,551
Just have your dad call
and say you need to see me.

664
00:33:25,634 --> 00:33:26,000
Okay.

665
00:33:26,001 --> 00:33:27,000
That would be out.

666
00:33:27,001 --> 00:33:28,000
Okay.

667
00:33:28,001 --> 00:33:29,000
Yeah.

668
00:33:29,001 --> 00:33:31,000
Because he freaks out.

669
00:33:31,001 --> 00:33:32,000
Yeah.

670
00:33:32,001 --> 00:33:36,000
No, he's worried about
his safety, which I told

671
00:33:36,001 --> 00:33:37,351
him, Brandi, I told him,
I'm like, you just call me.

672
00:33:37,352 --> 00:33:39,351
For him to call me and let me know.

673
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:44,000
But I told him, I'm like, I don't
think there's been an issue, but, yeah.

674
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:45,000
Okay.

675
00:33:45,001 --> 00:33:47,000
He's always worried.

676
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:49,150
He called me at 10 o'clock last night.

677
00:33:49,233 --> 00:33:53,000
[laughter]

678
00:33:53,001 --> 00:33:55,000
And then he texts, he's like,
call me as soon as you wake up.

679
00:33:55,001 --> 00:33:58,651
And when I woke up at 4:30, I'm like,
I don't think you really mean that.

680
00:33:58,734 --> 00:34:00,000
[laughter]

681
00:34:00,001 --> 00:34:01,751
I don't think you really mean that.

682
00:34:01,834 --> 00:34:03,000
[laughter]

683
00:34:03,001 --> 00:34:05,000
You and I are different hours, I think.

684
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:07,000
He doesn't sleep.

685
00:34:07,001 --> 00:34:08,000
He doesn't sleep?

686
00:34:08,001 --> 00:34:09,000
No.

687
00:34:09,001 --> 00:34:15,000
I don't know, I'd be
home, he'd be going out to

688
00:34:15,001 --> 00:34:17,000
eat, watching TV or
something, or he'd just be up.

689
00:34:17,001 --> 00:34:18,000
He doesn't know what's wrong with him.

690
00:34:18,001 --> 00:34:20,000
He doesn't sleep, though.

691
00:34:20,001 --> 00:34:25,001
Also, your family, like the most
supportive family I have of all my clients.

692
00:34:25,001 --> 00:34:29,000
The whole family shows up
to talk, like all the time.

693
00:34:29,001 --> 00:34:33,000
They're around you and out
there for you when you get back.

694
00:34:33,125 --> 00:34:35,000
Yeah.

695
00:34:35,001 --> 00:34:37,000
I miss them.

696
00:34:37,001 --> 00:34:38,151
Do they come and visit?

697
00:34:38,234 --> 00:34:39,000
Yeah.

698
00:34:39,001 --> 00:34:40,000
Nice.

699
00:34:40,001 --> 00:34:41,000
Yeah, they visit.

700
00:34:41,001 --> 00:34:43,401
And they have video visits
sometimes too, right?

701
00:34:43,402 --> 00:34:45,002
Do you have one of the toddlers?

702
00:34:45,085 --> 00:34:48,000
Yeah, I got a toddler.

703
00:34:48,001 --> 00:34:51,000
He escaped and next week is in person.

704
00:34:51,001 --> 00:34:52,000
Uh-huh.

705
00:34:52,001 --> 00:34:54,000
Yeah.

706
00:34:54,001 --> 00:34:56,401
Yeah, I thought the toddler
thing was ingenious.

707
00:34:56,484 --> 00:35:00,000
Yeah.

708
00:35:00,001 --> 00:35:01,000
Thank you.

709
00:35:01,001 --> 00:35:02,000
All right.

710
00:35:02,001 --> 00:35:03,000
Go get your tea.

711
00:35:03,001 --> 00:35:05,000
Thank you.

712
00:35:05,001 --> 00:35:06,000
Do you need to catch up
with me at all, Brandy?

713
00:35:06,001 --> 00:35:07,000
No, we good.

714
00:35:07,001 --> 00:35:08,000
All right, okay.

715
00:35:08,001 --> 00:35:09,000
Have a nice one.

716
00:35:09,001 --> 00:35:10,000
Enjoy your lunch.

717
00:35:10,001 --> 00:35:11,000
I will, you too.

718
00:35:11,001 --> 00:35:12,000
Enjoy your lunch.

719
00:35:12,001 --> 00:35:13,000
Nice to meet you.

720
00:35:13,001 --> 00:35:15,000
