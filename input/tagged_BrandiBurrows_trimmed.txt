[door opening] 

Charlie: They had to switch up your food because they didn't know you were going to McDonald's. So they're getting you some food from McDonald's. That's all right? 

Brandi Burrows: All right. What are you getting? 

Charlie: Big Macs, Quarter Pounder, they're getting a bunch of stuff. And fries and stuff. 

Brandi: I'm getting fish sandwich. 

Charlie: Fish sandwich? 

Brandi: Yeah, fish fillet. 

Charlie: Okay. 

Brandi: Yeah. 

Charlie: Let me tell you real quick. I'm going to have somebody show you some photos. 

Brandi: Hmm. 

Charlie: And see if you can remember the other person that was there at the time when the incident happened. All right? Okay. Give me two minutes. I can make you fish fillet. All right. [door opening]. [silence] [door closing] [silence] [door opening] [silence]. [door closing]. [silence]. [door opening]. [silence]. [door closing] [silence]. [door opening] [silence] [door closing]. [silence] [door opening] Good afternoon. How you doing? I'm good. You look good. My name is Detective Tate. I'm here on behalf of Detective Talley. He spoke with you already in reference to the photographic reprocess you're about to take part in. Yeah. Okay. Having said that, I'm going to read some instructions to you, okay? At any point in time, during the course of me reading these instructions to you, if you don't understand, you have a question, let me know. I'll stop. I'll explain it to you, and we'll move forward, okay? Okay. All right. Um, excuse me. As part of the ongoing investigation into the crime that occurred on June 18, 2022, in the 3800 block of Derby Manor Road, you'll be shown a series of photographs, okay? Mm-hmm. I am not involved in this investigation other than showing these photographs, and I do not know the identity of the suspect, okay? Mm-hmm. The person who committed the crime may or may not be in the set of photographs you're about to view. You understand that? Yes. The individuals you view may not appear exactly as they did on the date of the incident. Features such as head, facial hair are subject to change, okay? Yes. Photographs may not always depict the true complexion of a person and may be lighter or darker than shown in the photo, okay? Yes. Pay no attention to any markings and/or color defects that may appear on the photos and any other difference in the type or style of photographs, okay? Yes. You must look at all photographs contained in this file, okay? Yes. After you have the opportunity to view the photographs, I would ask you to follow on three questions. One, do you recognize anyone? Two, if you do, what number of persons do you recognize? And third, what role or opinion does the person play in this investigation, okay? Okay. Do not discuss with any other witnesses what you see, say, or do during this procedure, okay? Yes. And regardless of whether or not you select someone, the Baltimore City Police Department will continue to investigate this incident. Do you understand what I read to you? Yes. Do you have any questions for me? No. Okay. If you understand what I read to you, what I need you to do for me is place an initial on each one of those lines going down, initial date and time. [Pause] Oh, yeah. Today is 2/14/2013. The time is currently 1:45. Okay. [Pause] All right. Ms. Burrows, when you're ready, you can open that up. [Pause] [Pause] At this time, have you had the opportunity to look at all six photographs? Yes. Do you need to review the photographs again? No. Okay. Do you recognize anybody? No, not really. I'm missing one. Well, you can't look at them separately, so what I'm going to do is, if you want, I can reissue them again. You can take your time to look at them. Take your time. No rush. And we'll go from there, okay? Okay. [Pause] [Pause] Okay. And again, have you had the opportunity to view all six photographs? Yeah. Do you recognize anybody? No. All right. At this time, stand by at the Technical Aid magazine, okay? All right. [Pause] [Pause] [Pause] [Pause] [Pause] [Pause] [Pause] All right, London. Your food is on the way, and we have some other people from ATF who want to talk to you, all right? All right. Hey, I'm Dawn. How are you, Dawn? I'm from ATF. Yeah. This is Ted and Dan. How are you? Good. Yeah, you good? Yeah. Thanks. I'm not here to talk to you about the shooting that you're in here for. Do you know what ATF does? We're basically FBI's better brother where we handle violent crime, firearms, firearms trafficking, arsenic explosives is another group, but we're basically mostly violent crime. Oh, wow. So during the last time that you sat down with Tally and Jeff Naylor, the state's attorney, you had talked about the gun that you had in your possession. I'm a lawyer. Oh, oh, sorry. I'm making sure nothing is-- Hold on. All right. All right. When he said, "Oh, I'm going to go tell her her food's back," and I heard it, I was like, "Oh, I missed my cue." Oh, sorry. I just introduced him and was talking about what ATF does, which is-- Yeah. All right. Thank you. So when you were sitting down with Jeff Naylor before, you had said that the guns that they recovered on you, you had gotten with Devin and Dion down in Georgia. Do you remember that whole conversation? Yeah. So it piqued our interest about who it was that was buying guns in Atlanta and then how they were making their way to Baltimore because obviously Baltimore has a pretty high gun crime rate, and so we're kind of wondering where all the gun influx is coming from downtown. So those are the questions that I'll be asking, but if you want, we can just go with you, and then you say, and then if I have any follow-up questions, I can go from there. Okay. What do you think? First, I don't know exactly where they come from down there, but when I was down there, like a gun school, they go to a gun school, and just somebody had a license to get them, and they get them, and then they transport them back through like the Chinese bus, and that's how they get them back, through the Chinese bus, because you don't get searched on. Yeah, I mean, it's a really good thing because you put all your luggage below, and then you're riding, so you don't really have to own up to any of your stuff. That time that you went down with them, just those two, right, Devin and Dion? Yeah. Is that the only time that you went down with them? Yes. Do you know how many times--so I guess who is that main person that goes down? Devin. Devin? Yeah. And do you know Devin's last name? No. Would you be able to identify him if you saw him? Yes. Who is this person to you? That's Devin. That's Devin? Yeah. And then do you recognize this person? Yeah. Who is that? Dion. That's Dion? Yeah. Okay, so those two go down. Does Dion have family down there? Yeah, he has family down there. Who lives down there? His mom. Do you know her name? Shelly. Shelly. And who else lives down there? That's my mom. Okay. Is Shelly the one that was buying the guns? No. She doesn't know nothing about it. Oh, she doesn't. Okay. No. Who was the person buying the guns? It was somebody that Dion knew. Okay. And I don't know the guy per se. And do you remember what he looked like? I can't. I mean, he's black. Blackmailing it, Leanna, got it. Blackmailing it, blackmailing it. I don't really know him personally because I didn't really get introduced to him. Okay. Do you remember his name? No. Okay. And you only met him that one time? Yeah. Do you think if you saw a picture of him, you'd be able to recognize him? Not really because I only did a quick drive and then, you know, this, exchange and gone. So. All right. Let's just go through when you went down there. You went down there on the Chinese bus. Did somebody take you over to the bus station? We called Uber to the house. Who paid for that Uber? I did. And you have an Uber account? Yes. And what was the address of the house that you guys went to? I don't know. Okay. I don't remember. A street name? I don't know. A street name. Yeah. Who gave you the address to the house? The. And whose house was it? It was, I think it was his father's house. I think it was his father's house. Okay. And who did you meet when you got there? His father and the kids and stuff. How many kids? It was like one, two, five of them. Do you remember his dad's name? No. Do you remember what he looked like? No. Or how old the kids were? I don't know. They were young kids. Yeah. I want to say like four of the ten. And was there any females or anybody else living at the house besides the dad and kids? No. Okay. No. And would that be his father and then mother would be Shelly at a different house? Yeah. All right. That house that you guys drove to, is that like an apartment, a single family home? That just means like one house? It was a single family home. Single family. All right. And what happened when you guys got there? We went down there. We chilled for a little bit. We went out, partied and stuff like that. And then I left. I wound up leaving them down there. And I left and caught the bus back by myself. Well, during that time you guys bought a gun, right? Yeah. So let's say you guys bought a gun. It was already brought. Oh, okay. I just got it from -- And who did you get it from? I just got it from Devin Hedges. I just got it from him. Oh, okay. And had Devin gotten it while he was down there or did he come down with it? No, he didn't come down with it. He left and in exchange he got it from the guy that I told you about. And then that's when I got it from him and that was that. Okay. And I left and came back down here because I had to go to work. Did Devin leave at some point or did he meet in the dad's house? No, when we went out, I want to say like it was a downtown area down there. And we met him down there or whatever. They just called by the Actons. What is it? Vine. The street was called Vine and Actons. Okay. So we met down there, whatever the case might be. And after that, we went up, we went out, we just chilled and went out. And Devin had the gun the whole time or he gave it to you at that time? No, he had it the whole time. And then when I wound up leaving, I got it. Okay. And do you know if any other guns were exchanged during that time? No, I don't know about all that. And you only came up with the one gun? The one I had. What kind of gun that was? I think it was a nine, I think. Nine, really no gun like that. Okay. That was my first gun. Is that the gun that you were later arrested with? Yes. You're positive? Yes. Okay. And Devin and Dion stayed down there? Yeah, they stayed down there. And you don't know if they came back at that time with any guns? No, I don't know. And you only met whoever it was that gave the gun on that street and they had exchanged? Yeah, they exchanged. Do you know if they exchanged money as well? No, it was just a bag exchange. Do you remember how he passed the guns to him? In a bag. In a bag? Yeah. Like a double bag? A double bag. Did they talk like they had done that before? No, they just shot it up for him and then boom, that's how the car was set in the car. He got in the bag, boom, he got in the car and we left. Okay. Did you see that guy arrive in a car? Yeah, he was already there. Do you remember what kind of car he had? I think it was white. I want to say a white Honda, I want to say. Okay. A white BMW, one of them. It was white though. And then how did you come into possession of that gun? Like when they got in the car, did they give it to you? No, I had it. When I was ready to leave, when I was ready to go back, he gave it to me. He offered it or you asked to buy it? No, I didn't buy it. I was like, "Cousin, I like that, let me get that." He gave it to me. That's nice of him. I didn't buy nothing though. Okay. And then obviously he had other guns in that double bag if they-- Yeah, I guess, yeah, I think so. And brought it back up here. Do you know how many times that they've gone down there and then brought guns back up? They go back and forth sometimes, for real, for real. But I know that's how they get them back on the Chinese bus. And did they talk any more about the guy that was buying them? No, I ain't really discussed him for real. You said in that last--I'm sure you forgot because it was like a year ago, a year prior, but the name Rashard, do you remember that? Yeah. Who was that for? The father. But not the same person who was exchanging the guns? No. I see. And you said that Devin and Dion are usually carrying guns on them? Yeah. Do you know who they're selling to when they get back up here? Anybody. Anybody. Do you know how much they're making on the guns? I don't know, probably about $1,000. Per handgun? Yeah. That's a pretty good markup. And do you know where they're getting the money to originally buy them down south? I think in profit from what they make in offer, like a flip. Yeah, and then they just deduce the profit. That's just from what I'm thinking. Yeah, that makes sense. Do you know how they usually exchange money? Is it like digital like Venmo or is it cash? I think it should be cash. Cash. I don't think it should be all no cash happening out of there. You would think. Yeah. And you don't know how many times they've gone down there? Do you recognize this person at all? I don't know who that is. Okay. Do you remember what--and I guess you didn't go to the gun store with him. That was just a street. In your phone, the phone they took from you during the search warrant that was cracked and maybe broken, do you know if any of the messages or telephone numbers or anything exchanged, anything would be important in there? No. Nothing important in there? No, not important in there. I don't think they were ever able to get into it, but I also don't think that they got a search warrant. I don't know how you feel about a consent to search. I don't actually know that they'd be able to break it, but I guess it's possible. It's like a broken phone, but we can always try. A broken phone. I think the screen was cracked. It just didn't turn on correctly. It just kept flickering on and off. My phone won't crank. Oh, really? Maybe it's a different phone. What kind of phone did you have when you got it? An iPhone. This was an iPhone in a white case. That's not my phone. Okay. I gave them my phone information. Okay. They had my phone information. I mean, it sounds like none of the information would be in the phone anyway, so it's not that big of a deal. The guy that was selling the guns, you don't know how he's related, do you? No. Or if related at all. I don't know. Do you guys have any questions? Did they ever ask you about the gun afterwards when you came back to Baltimore to be honored, Devin? No, they asked me about nothing. They never said what happened to it, even after you got arrested? No. I don't talk to none. I don't talk to nobody. What makes you think that that guy that Devin and Dion got that gun from is the same guy that purchased them, or do you not know? I say that because from just regular conversations, we find that this is us talking. That's how it was brought up. That makes sense. Do you remember if the guns were in boxes? No, they wasn't in boxes. They was new, though, but they wasn't in boxes. You could tell that they were new? Yeah. You had mentioned something about an AR, or like a long rifle. Do you remember what that was? I couldn't really understand on the tape what you had said. What you mean? You said that they bring handguns, and one time you knew that they had brought a rifle up. Yeah. Was that during that trip? Not the trip that I was on, but prior to when they came back, we was chilling one night over at Nardi House, and they showed me it, or whatever, and they just got rid of it. They sold it to somebody. I see. Do you know any actual person that they sold it to? No. I don't really know the people. They just sold it to people. Okay. I asked people that they knew. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't know. Do you remember that night, the date of that night that you were hanging out that they sold it? No. I just moved here. I don't remember. But you think that that AR came from Georgia? Yeah. I ain't going to go to that on here. Yeah, Maryland's pretty tough to get a gun from. Yeah. Were you ever there during a sale of a gun? What do you mean? Like were you ever present watching Deon or Devin sell the gun to somebody else? No. Only that day I saw them give it to somebody. The AR? Yeah. And do you remember what month that was maybe? I don't know what month. I think you were arrested in June. You thought that maybe in May was when you had gone down there? Yeah, I went down there sometime. I don't even remember for real. I arrested, but it was like, I don't want to say like, I'm trying to think of the weather. You said it had been nice down there, so they were thinking like maybe spring. I don't want to say, probably spring because it wasn't cold or nothing. So probably spring. All right. And then the AR thing, did that happen before that time that you went down? No, it hadn't happened. Okay. I had gone down. So between May and June? Yeah, probably. Yeah. And you don't remember who they had sold to? Did somebody come to the house? No. No, we was out. We was out somewhere. I ain't come to no house. Okay. Nothing. Did you say before you were at Noddy's house? Yeah. Who's Noddy? My homeboy. You got out first last night? No, I don't know. It just called Noddy. I got you. Where's that house at? Like over east, Erdman. Erdman? Yeah. You know like, what part of Erdman? I don't know the address of the apartment. The host apartment? Yeah. Okay. You remember what they looked like? Was it like low rises, high rises, like garden style? Was it like a big tall building? Were they small? I mean, it was like the apartments. Okay. Yeah, it was like the apartments. During any type of exchange or even through talk, do you think it was more Devin running the show or Dion running the show? I think it was more Devin running the show. And I guess Dion would be the connect if it was down in Atlanta. Isn't that where his family lives? Yeah. I guess Dion set it up and then Devin would get people up here. And do you know who would handle the money? No, I don't know what I like. Okay. Do you know if they're locked up? I don't know. Do you think that they would still-- I don't talk to anyone. I've been locked up. I only speak to my family. That's good. All right. Can you think of anything else that I missed? No, you got anything? When you said the gun license, do you know if that's like a license to carry or just that they can easily purchase guns down there? I mean, if you got a gun license, what is it for? So different states have different requirements. So like in Maryland, sometimes you have to have like a handgun license to be able to purchase, you know, or you can circumvent the system. But sometimes if you have a handgun license down in Georgia, you can just show that and then you don't have to go through different backgrounds. I'm pretty sure if you got a handgun license, then you can purchase a gun, right? Right. Usually. But you never saw them actually have a license. No, I don't know about that. Okay. I can't think of anything else. They were messed with like ghost guns or P-80s or plastic guns. I don't know about all that. I don't know about guns. That was my first gun. I don't even play around with them for real. It was just for protection. Okay. Yeah. All right, I think that's all I have. [knocking] [inaudible] He's been relaxing. [laughter] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [laughter] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] Is it pretty rough tonight? Not really. I've been like that before. So you know the system all of it? I'm patient with it, yeah. Well, I know how healthy you've been after this, and so hopefully they see that, you know? And especially I was listening to your part of what -- the shooting situation, so hopefully they understand that that was not fully your deal. It wasn't at all. [silence] Do you want me to watch your eyes with the intercom? No, you will not. Sometimes the text messages don't go through. That's why I ended up calling back. I was like -- because I thought it was being delivered on my end, but it wasn't being read. He just responded, okay. Okay. [inaudible] All right, we'll go back in there. And if you can think of anything else as far as gun trafficking or guns or violence goes, we're always interested. I will. Get in touch with your defense attorney. Okay. Just letting you know if you have some more information, are you remembered or, you know, anything. Okay. Just have your dad call and say you need to see me. Okay. That would be out. Okay. Yeah. Because he freaks out. Yeah. No, he's worried about his safety, which I told him, Brandi, I told him, I'm like, you just call me. For him to call me and let me know. But I told him, I'm like, I don't think there's been an issue, but, yeah. Okay. He's always worried. He called me at 10 o'clock last night. [laughter] And then he texts, he's like, call me as soon as you wake up. And when I woke up at 4:30, I'm like, I don't think you really mean that. [laughter] I don't think you really mean that. [laughter] You and I are different hours, I think. He doesn't sleep. He doesn't sleep? No. I don't know, I'd be home, he'd be going out to eat, watching TV or something, or he'd just be up. He doesn't know what's wrong with him. He doesn't sleep, though. Also, your family, like the most supportive family I have of all my clients. The whole family shows up to talk, like all the time. They're around you and out there for you when you get back. Yeah. I miss them. Do they come and visit? Yeah. Nice. Yeah, they visit. And they have video visits sometimes too, right? Do you have one of the toddlers? Yeah, I got a toddler. He escaped and next week is in person. Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah, I thought the toddler thing was ingenious. Yeah. Thank you. All right. Go get your tea. Thank you. Do you need to catch up with me at all, Brandy? No, we good. All right, okay. Have a nice one. Enjoy your lunch. I will, you too. Enjoy your lunch. Nice to meet you. Same here. We're waiting for your food to come, Brandy. Slide them up here. Slide them down for you first down here. If you can, let me get another cigarette. Okay, I got you. You need more water? I think you're talking to the wrong people. Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
