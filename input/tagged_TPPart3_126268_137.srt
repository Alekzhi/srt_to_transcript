1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
ff1 Like, literally, yeah, two and
three, just like four and three, yeah.

2
00:00:04,003 --> 00:00:05,680
ff2 Exactly, so, in that moment, we-, it
will-,

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,240
they wouldn't have been able to maybe say

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,520
or explain many things
that they would have wanted

5
00:00:12,521 --> 00:00:15,520
to kind of explain or explore a little bit

6
00:00:15,521 --> 00:00:19,600
more, understand, but
now, we've spoken to them, you know,

7
00:00:19,601 --> 00:00:21,720
obviously not all
seven-year-olds are the same,

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:25,440
or not all six-year-olds are
the same, but Oscar and Sienna

9
00:00:25,441 --> 00:00:28,160
are very articulate, very,
very sort of communicative,

10
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,080
they've got a great relationship
with you, we've seen

11
00:00:32,081 --> 00:00:34,120
it, I've seen it. I'm sure
Wanz and I have seen it too.

12
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:39,120
So, uhm, those are things that we look out
for.

13
00:00:39,495 --> 00:00:42,520
We look out for, okay, you know, if
they've got a good relationship

14
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,240
with their parent or their safe parent,
then they will be able to feel confident

15
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:49,690
to tell their parent
something has happened.

16
00:00:49,773 --> 00:00:50,880
ff1 Yeah. Okay.

17
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:55,880
ff2 So, yeah, so, those are
safeguards in place.

18
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,880
We will not be able to completely
take away the risk, mitigate the risk,

19
00:00:59,881 --> 00:01:03,320
but we can manage it
safely for the children.

20
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,770
ff1 Yeah, as best as everyone can.

21
00:01:05,853 --> 00:01:09,443
ff2 As best- ff1 And we just have to hope.

22
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,511
Yeah, we have to look forward
and it's as simple as that.

23
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,240
We can't, you know, otherwise, you drive

24
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,800
yourself crazy looking,
you know, in the past.

25
00:01:16,925 --> 00:01:18,120
ff2 Looking back... ff1 Yeah.

26
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:20,421
ff2 And it doesn't mean that
if there's any worry,

27
00:01:20,504 --> 00:01:24,600
this is why we give Oscar
and Sienna the education.

28
00:01:24,601 --> 00:01:26,400
ff1 And the tools. ff2 And the tools.

29
00:01:26,401 --> 00:01:31,040
And we give you as well the same education
and tools around things to look out for,

30
00:01:31,365 --> 00:01:33,920
things to look out for in terms of,

31
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,920
okay, questioning, it's to
change this behavior,

32
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:41,200
to change how has this affected this mood
and all this stuff, things like that.

33
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:45,480
But it needs to be... Uhm, this is where
that's--

34
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:50,760
ff1 And I think it's really hard, even with
the, like, for example, at the moment,

35
00:01:50,761 --> 00:01:54,640
the children, their
appetites are so, small.

36
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,000
And I'm like, is that
because of the hey-fee bit?

37
00:01:57,001 --> 00:01:58,600
Is that, you know, just
some of your appetites,

38
00:01:58,601 --> 00:02:01,151
even us adults, isn't that
appetite goes a bit less

39
00:02:01,234 --> 00:02:03,720
and then you're like,
happy, there's a cold day. la1  ff2 Yeah, yeah. ff1

40
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:07,040
Tuck into a, you know, a big
hearty meal sort of thing.

41
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:13,480
So, then it's like, you know, it's so, tricky
because I think your natural instinct

42
00:02:13,481 --> 00:02:16,720
is just to, there's a problem
and you're, not problem,

43
00:02:16,721 --> 00:02:20,400
you know, there's an issue and then
you think, okay, then what could it be?

44
00:02:20,401 --> 00:02:24,331
And you're constantly like, oh,
it's probably just the hey-fee, you know,

45
00:02:24,414 --> 00:02:27,840
the coughing or whatever, you
just don't feel quite right.

46
00:02:27,841 --> 00:02:30,360
Oh, you know, they're
coming to the end of a term,

47
00:02:30,361 --> 00:02:32,611
you know, they're feeling
a little bit tired.

48
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:37,040
Oh, you know, they might just, you know,
I'm sure they'll start eating again

49
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:41,092
when they've gone through a growth spurt
and, you know, all of a sudden, you know.

50
00:02:41,175 --> 00:02:44,480
So, like, you know,
they've gone from eating

51
00:02:44,481 --> 00:02:47,480
like, almost like a large
chicken breast each.

52
00:02:47,481 --> 00:02:51,680
So, where I always used to
buy a whole chicken and

53
00:02:51,681 --> 00:02:53,800
basically we used to finish
that whole chicken together.

54
00:02:53,801 --> 00:02:55,920
Like, you know, I'm only having to cook

55
00:02:55,921 --> 00:02:59,800
like half a chicken now
and even that we had like...

56
00:02:59,801 --> 00:03:02,760
so, we had half a chicken
and that was two meals.

57
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:03,800
It's just like...

58
00:03:03,801 --> 00:03:04,657
ff2 "What's going on?" Yeah.

59
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,360
ff1 "Why are you not eating so, less?"

60
00:03:06,361 --> 00:03:08,360
But then you see, but this
is the thing, isn't it?

61
00:03:08,361 --> 00:03:10,920
You think, but like, you
know, you just think like,

62
00:03:10,921 --> 00:03:14,040
okay, probably just the
sunshine, probably just tired.

63
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:18,640
And then, you know, sometimes children
have like, you know, two or three or,

64
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,120
it might go for a week or
week and a half of not eating.

65
00:03:21,121 --> 00:03:23,040
And then all of a sudden-
ff2 They eat more and more.

66
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:24,120
ff1 They're like, "Mom, can I have
seconds?"

67
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:27,720
You're like, "No, I've just got
into making smaller portions

68
00:03:27,721 --> 00:03:30,400
and not eating the same
food for three days."

69
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:31,240
ff2 Yeah, yeah. ff1 You know?

70
00:03:31,241 --> 00:03:32,440
ff2 And you're absolutely right.

71
00:03:32,441 --> 00:03:34,091
You're doing all of those things.

72
00:03:34,092 --> 00:03:36,042
ff1 Yeah, so, it's quite tricky, isn't it?

73
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:38,680
Like, you know, even like
we're saying about size

74
00:03:38,681 --> 00:03:41,400
and you're like, what's not,
like, you know, you could

75
00:03:41,401 --> 00:03:43,400
ask me and I'd say, yeah,
that's not normal for them.

76
00:03:43,401 --> 00:03:47,400
But then, you know, then you take into,
you know, everything into account.

77
00:03:47,401 --> 00:03:49,551
ff2 And I think it's,
like you say, it's one,

78
00:03:49,634 --> 00:03:53,680
you have to pay attention to
not just, I know one sign,

79
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,760
if their appetite has decreased,

80
00:03:56,761 --> 00:03:59,880
it could just, like you say,
be a multiple of things, right?

81
00:03:59,881 --> 00:04:02,720
But there needs to be more than one sign.

82
00:04:02,721 --> 00:04:04,840
ff1 To pick up to some other ones.

83
00:04:04,841 --> 00:04:08,721
ff2 Yeah, there needs to be more than
one, or like you've also, noticed,

84
00:04:08,722 --> 00:04:12,240
and it could also, be
physical signs as well.

85
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:15,320
If you notice there was some,
maybe if your child was like,

86
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:17,840
"Oh, you know, all the
attention is doing this

87
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,160
to get around."

88
00:04:19,161 --> 00:04:20,400
What's wrong with you around?

89
00:04:20,401 --> 00:04:21,400
That kind of thing.

90
00:04:21,401 --> 00:04:23,051
- But Sienna's very affectionate.

91
00:04:23,134 --> 00:04:25,240
She just wants to sit on me.

92
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:29,320
She'll sit there and kiss me and kiss
me and say, oh, you don't pull my face.

93
00:04:29,321 --> 00:04:30,771
And just kiss me and kiss me.

94
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:31,680
She loves it.

95
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,600
She's like really affectionate.

96
00:04:33,601 --> 00:04:37,080
And she just like, she likes
really like strong cuddles.

97
00:04:37,081 --> 00:04:38,840
She's like, squeeze me, squeeze me.

98
00:04:38,841 --> 00:04:41,600
And I'm like, I can't
squeeze you that hard.

99
00:04:41,601 --> 00:04:44,160
So, she loves like, like
if I'm sitting here,

100
00:04:44,161 --> 00:04:46,920
she'll come in behind me and
say, "Mommy, lean on me."

101
00:04:46,921 --> 00:04:48,280
I'm like, no, you'll get it.

102
00:04:48,281 --> 00:04:49,120
- Because it's comfortable around you.

103
00:04:49,121 --> 00:04:50,071
- But she likes it.

104
00:04:50,154 --> 00:04:51,040
She likes that.

105
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:54,800
Whereas Oscar's a little bit,
you know, he likes his, you know,

106
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:57,320
like it might be different
between boys and girls.

107
00:04:57,321 --> 00:05:01,551
Might be different between just like, you
know, just what they like sort of thing.

108
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:04,680
But anyway, I'm sorry,
you've completely gone off them.

109
00:05:04,681 --> 00:05:05,600
- Oh, no, no, no.

110
00:05:05,601 --> 00:05:08,151
I think to be honest, you
do know the right things.

111
00:05:08,234 --> 00:05:10,785
You're obviously noticing
when things are changing.

112
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,000
for your children and you
are responding appropriately.

113
00:05:13,001 --> 00:05:17,880
Even if you're sort of giving it time to,
giving it time to kind of let them sort of

114
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,131
come out of that funk.

115
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:21,320
And you are doing all the right things.

116
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,307
If you're not sure, you
take them to the doctors.

117
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:27,600
If not, you kind of see, okay, maybe,
but you can also, like you say,

118
00:05:27,601 --> 00:05:29,751
if you see that they
change for the better,

119
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,741
but if you also, see another
sort of coupling sign

120
00:05:32,824 --> 00:05:36,360
as well, maybe, you know,
irritable or something,

121
00:05:36,361 --> 00:05:40,000
or like you will not wanting to get out
of bed, then actually those kind of be,

122
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:42,920
not indication about this, but indication
maybe they're not feeling very well.

123
00:05:42,921 --> 00:05:44,440
- Well, you know guys, yeah.

124
00:05:44,441 --> 00:05:45,841
- Yeah, I think that I know.

125
00:05:45,842 --> 00:05:49,640
- Yeah, so, I put it down to the hay fever
because he is kind of like, you know,

126
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:53,920
I give him some of this Pyrites,
the children's one at nighttime.

127
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:56,400
And then sort of like, and then I think,

128
00:05:56,807 --> 00:05:57,640
okay, then, you know, that stops.

129
00:05:57,641 --> 00:06:00,320
But I can see when he
comes home from school,

130
00:06:00,321 --> 00:06:02,640
it's the more of the coughing, isn't it?

131
00:06:02,641 --> 00:06:04,840
- Yes, that's around now.

132
00:06:04,841 --> 00:06:06,391
- Coughing, coughing, coughing.

133
00:06:06,474 --> 00:06:08,353
And then, but you can hear it's like,

134
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:10,680
it's like a, not tickly cough.

135
00:06:10,681 --> 00:06:12,881
You can hear it's a
different type of cough.

136
00:06:12,964 --> 00:06:15,760
You can hear it in the
coffee, it's different.

137
00:06:15,761 --> 00:06:17,811
- You do know the right things, you know.

138
00:06:17,894 --> 00:06:22,160
So, in terms of their care
and how they're looked after,

139
00:06:22,161 --> 00:06:24,440
all those sort of things,
that's not a worry for us.

140
00:06:24,441 --> 00:06:27,651
If that was a worry, you know,
it would have been in the report.

141
00:06:27,734 --> 00:06:30,000
So, there wasn't anything around that.

142
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:32,800
So, you know, the kids
are being looked after.

143
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:34,400
They've got a good relationship with you.

144
00:06:34,401 --> 00:06:35,902
They are doing well at school.

145
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,880
They're having art therapy,
which is else to support.

146
00:06:38,881 --> 00:06:41,000
They are having contact with dad.

147
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:41,957
- I've just remembered something.

148
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,400
- They're having contact with dad,

149
00:06:43,401 --> 00:06:45,867
which is supervised, and
that's going really well.

150
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,372
So, that's not an issue right now.

151
00:06:47,455 --> 00:06:50,600
And you are going back to court
and hopefully we'll seek mediation.

152
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,901
The thing that we'll
be looking to support.

153
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,400
will be to improve communication

154
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,120
for the benefit of the children.

155
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:00,080
So, I don't know what the
future is gonna be like.

156
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,320
Maybe the judge would say, yeah,
supervised contact should continue,

157
00:07:03,321 --> 00:07:06,271
but it needs to sort of be
managed with the family members.

158
00:07:06,272 --> 00:07:08,951
You already have your family
members already to plan.

159
00:07:08,952 --> 00:07:12,120
- I've asked two friends as well,
but then they weren't clear.

160
00:07:12,121 --> 00:07:16,440
I wasn't clear actually for them whether
they had to stay or what, you know,

161
00:07:16,441 --> 00:07:19,360
to what degree and where
and stuff like that.

162
00:07:19,361 --> 00:07:22,520
So, I was thinking, well,
you know, they've given

163
00:07:22,521 --> 00:07:24,080
me a yes, but they've
got like more questions.

164
00:07:24,081 --> 00:07:26,080
Like, do they have to
stay there the whole time?

165
00:07:26,081 --> 00:07:30,161
- That would be a conversation for us
to have in terms of the network meeting.

166
00:07:30,244 --> 00:07:38,720
If you can email me the details of- - Or
do they have to like, just a handover?

167
00:07:39,415 --> 00:07:41,280
Like, will the time be constant?

168
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:44,520
- I think it will be tricky for us.

169
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,121
to really have some clarity on basically.

170
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,637
what that would look like until October.

171
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,621
Because you are going back to October,
you're going back to court in October.

172
00:07:53,622 --> 00:07:55,381
And for the moment right now,

173
00:07:55,631 --> 00:07:57,720
you've got something in place

174
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:02,240
in terms of CGC is in place until October.

175
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,091
But then what happens after October?

176
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,040
If the judge recommends
unsupervised contact.

177
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,120
or if the judge recommends
supporting contact,

178
00:08:10,121 --> 00:08:14,791
or if the judge recommends that
contacts continue to take place,

179
00:08:14,792 --> 00:08:18,920
or the judge can actually say, "I
want another assessment to take place.

180
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:21,400
I want another CAFCAS worker to come out."

181
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:27,901
And that's what we got from the CAFCAS
worker to say, when they go back in October,

182
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:31,031
I have recommended another
guardian, you know,

183
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,560
to take another assessment
or whatever it is.

184
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:37,160
So, we don't know what the
judge is going to say.

185
00:08:37,161 --> 00:08:40,440
- So, what you've spoken,
so, what with CAFCAS now?

186
00:08:41,474 --> 00:08:42,307
- I'm sorry?

187
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,320
- You spoke to CAFCAS now?

188
00:08:43,321 --> 00:08:44,960
- No, no, no, in the assessment.

189
00:08:44,961 --> 00:08:47,880
- In the assessment, in
the CAFCAS assessment.

190
00:08:47,881 --> 00:08:49,760
Oh, if we go back to court.

191
00:08:49,761 --> 00:08:52,200
Oh, that's if we go back to court before.

192
00:08:52,201 --> 00:08:54,520
No, before October, in between.

193
00:08:54,521 --> 00:08:56,080
- Are you planning to go
back to court in between?

194
00:08:56,081 --> 00:08:57,120
- No, no, no, no.

195
00:08:57,121 --> 00:08:59,120
The guardian that she's saying then

196
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:03,680
is if there's like issues
between me and Richard.

197
00:09:03,681 --> 00:09:04,520
- Right, okay.

198
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:08,880
- Before the, so, we
were in court in March.

199
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:12,200
So, between March and
October, so, here in October,

200
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:18,040
so, while all of the visits happening,
if there's issues between us

201
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:21,080
and we can't figure things
out or there's like, you know,

202
00:09:21,081 --> 00:09:25,781
then if we go back to court, then
there should be a guardian appointed.

203
00:09:25,864 --> 00:09:27,720
- Okay, okay, that's fine.

204
00:09:27,721 --> 00:09:28,721
So, that's fine then.

205
00:09:28,804 --> 00:09:31,160
So, in that case, you've got your network.

206
00:09:31,161 --> 00:09:33,611
I think we don't know what
that's gonna look like

207
00:09:33,694 --> 00:09:37,844
come September, come October,
what the judge would say.

208
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:43,080
If the judge is wanting it
to continue to be supported,

209
00:09:43,081 --> 00:09:45,960
then your friend's
brother will have to stay,

210
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:49,440
but they won't have to
interact with Richard.

211
00:09:49,441 --> 00:09:52,160
They will just need to be in the vicinity

212
00:09:52,161 --> 00:09:55,200
and just watch and just,
you know, just be around.

213
00:09:55,201 --> 00:09:56,040
That's it.

214
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,720
But if the judge is saying, actually,

215
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:05,320
it can progress to unsupervised, you
know, and obviously getting the children,

216
00:10:05,321 --> 00:10:08,554
like we said, this keepsake work
would already sort of be there.

217
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,287
and get them, Gauge their
understanding of it.

218
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:15,120
and all of those things like that,
then the children will be able to say

219
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,800
if they were ever, ever
at risk or in danger.

220
00:10:18,287 --> 00:10:19,337
Does that make sense?

221
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,000
- Yeah.

222
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,800
- And that would just act like
a natural safeguard anyway.

223
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,640
And yeah, then it does be a case of, okay,

224
00:10:28,641 --> 00:10:31,640
are we asking that the children
be collected from here?

225
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:35,160
That would obviously mean that Richard
is coming here to pick up the children.

226
00:10:35,161 --> 00:10:37,061
How comfortable is it for both of you?

227
00:10:37,144 --> 00:10:38,103
Is it really okay?

228
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,107
Is it really safe?

229
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:40,109
Maybe not.

230
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,357
Maybe we can ask your friend
to pick the children up

231
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,790
from here and take them
to like maybe somewhere

232
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:45,920
around the local park.

233
00:10:45,921 --> 00:10:46,760
- Yeah, there's something there.

234
00:10:46,761 --> 00:10:49,111
- And then Richard can pick them
up from the park or something.

235
00:10:49,194 --> 00:10:51,844
I don't really know what
would be sort of the option,

236
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,280
but this could be things
that could be explored later.

237
00:10:54,281 --> 00:10:58,680
I think if we'd like have a constant place

238
00:10:58,681 --> 00:11:00,000
that we meet, I think that would be good.

239
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:03,581
Rather, yeah, yeah, but we don't know,
we don't know how it's gonna work out.

240
00:11:03,582 --> 00:11:04,701
- Yeah, we don't know.

241
00:11:04,702 --> 00:11:07,560
So, we're only speculating, so, please
don't hold me to ransom on that.

242
00:11:07,561 --> 00:11:10,400
- Yeah, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

243
00:11:10,401 --> 00:11:15,040
I think sometimes I worry
about like saying things.

244
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:22,640
because like, yeah, like you might
feel that that's how I envision it.

245
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:25,440
It's like, but this is more
of like a sharing of ideas.

246
00:11:25,441 --> 00:11:26,891
- Yeah, 'cause we don't know.

247
00:11:26,892 --> 00:11:27,992
- Yeah, we don't know.

248
00:11:28,075 --> 00:11:31,400
- And the judge, like I say,
has the ultimate decision.

249
00:11:31,401 --> 00:11:34,920
Even if we recommended
that supervised contact

250
00:11:34,921 --> 00:11:37,271
or supportive contact
needs to sort of continue

251
00:11:37,354 --> 00:11:40,960
until the children are 10
or something like that,

252
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,960
the judge could actually
say, no, it's not feasible.

253
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:49,000
And he doesn't want that
or actually, no, it's not,

254
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:51,600
we've had that, we've had
that many, many times.

255
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:56,321
So, the judge, at the end of the
day, that's why he's a judge.

256
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,640
He sees all the evidences,
reads everything,

257
00:11:59,641 --> 00:12:02,400
and he makes decisions or whatever it is.

258
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,477
If you're unhappy with
any of the decisions that

259
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,560
he's made, you can sit
to a lawyer and appeal it

260
00:12:06,561 --> 00:12:09,040
or have a contested or
something, I don't know.

261
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:14,400
All of the things about your solicitors
or legal will advise you accordingly.

262
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:17,640
However, the hope is that
now that you've progressed

263
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:21,090
to where you are, children are
having some level of contact,

264
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,750
you should be able to come to
an amicable sort of agreement.

265
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,960
with Richard in mediation.

266
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:29,520
- To be able to, yeah,
I think the mediation,

267
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:33,160
that will like, I think that will help.

268
00:12:33,161 --> 00:12:34,840
- Yeah. - Definitely.

269
00:12:34,841 --> 00:12:36,800
Just two things while you were talking.

270
00:12:36,801 --> 00:12:42,800
So, firstly, so, I know
we've got school as part

271
00:12:42,801 --> 00:12:46,280
and I'd asked Mo to
answer this and she said,

272
00:12:46,281 --> 00:12:49,880
no, we've got school, but I'll
ask you the question as well.

273
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:54,680
So, the children have private
tutors that they see once a week.

274
00:12:54,980 --> 00:13:02,760
So, I don't know whether they should be
part of like this conference and like,

275
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:08,040
you can get more of an understanding
of like what Oscar and Sienna are like,

276
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:11,280
'cause then they see them
face to face like once a week.

277
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:15,840
So, they've got two
different private tutors

278
00:13:15,841 --> 00:13:18,840
and then they've got another
one, so, they do this perform.

279
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:21,680
They absolutely love Dom and
Ria, they're like really.

280
00:13:21,705 --> 00:13:24,455
So, I don't know whether you'd
want like input from them

281
00:13:24,538 --> 00:13:27,880
or want them to be a part of
this conference and stuff.

282
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:29,160
- Can I ask you a question?

283
00:13:29,161 --> 00:13:31,960
- Okay.
- Just to kind of follow up on what you're asking me. - Okay.

284
00:13:31,961 --> 00:13:34,311
- And I'm not gonna make
that decision for you,

285
00:13:34,394 --> 00:13:37,394
but I just wanted to kind
of have a think about it.

286
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,422
- Okay.
- How long have they had the tutors?

287
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:48,451
- One of them they've been seeing for about two years, I think.
- Two years.

288
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:50,352
- And the other one for about, Judith,

289
00:13:50,435 --> 00:13:54,040
they've seen her since
about September before that.

290
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:57,674
No, I think it was September they
started, 'cause of this academic year.

291
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:00,200
- Okay. - I can't remember.

292
00:14:00,201 --> 00:14:02,360
- So, one they've had about two years.

293
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,200
and one they've had about a year.

294
00:14:04,201 --> 00:14:06,680
- Yeah, so, they say, yeah, and then, yeah,

295
00:14:06,681 --> 00:14:09,581
Dom and Ria, they've had them
for about two years as well.

296
00:14:09,664 --> 00:14:12,560
- What are their focus in
terms of, not the learning,

297
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:15,161
but in terms of the key
stage that they're teaching?

298
00:14:15,244 --> 00:14:17,760
- What do you mean?

299
00:14:17,761 --> 00:14:21,920
- So, usually when you
have a tutor, they teach,

300
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:25,000
so, like as education sector,
they're split in like

301
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,640
a key stage one, key stage
two, key stage three.

302
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,880
What is their focus?

303
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,440
Is it key stage one, key stage two?

304
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:31,480
Do you know what that means?

305
00:14:31,481 --> 00:14:33,360
- Yeah, yeah, I know what
key stages means, yeah.

306
00:14:33,361 --> 00:14:36,160
- Okay, so, key stage three is secondary
school, so, they're not there yet.

307
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,060
- No, yeah.

308
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:40,640
- But they're around key stage one.

309
00:14:40,641 --> 00:14:41,591
- One. - Yeah, one.

310
00:14:41,674 --> 00:14:43,840
- But they're going to two, yeah.

311
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:47,440
- Key stage two, when
they start to year three.

312
00:14:47,441 --> 00:14:51,400
Now, teachers are focused
with different key stages.

313
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:53,950
Sometimes if you're a
teacher in a primary school,

314
00:14:54,033 --> 00:14:57,440
you can only teach
reception at key stage one,

315
00:14:57,441 --> 00:15:01,560
when you teach key stage
two, and that's it.

316
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:04,760
You might not be able
to flip between the two.

317
00:15:04,761 --> 00:15:07,040
That was ages ago, like before 2007,

318
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:14,360
you could flip between the two.

319
00:15:14,361 --> 00:15:19,360
But after 2007 or 2008, you
couldn't flip between the two.

320
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,910
You had to pick a
specialty or pick an area.

321
00:15:25,993 --> 00:15:30,640
So, I'm asking because at some point,
does the teachers will change?

322
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,280
Or would they not change?

323
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:35,040
You don't know.

324
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,960
- I don't know.

325
00:15:36,961 --> 00:15:46,040
But then I know with Judith, I
think she tutors um, what's it?

326
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:48,080
So, stats is the school one.

327
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:50,731
11 plus is the one that they
get into grammar school.

328
00:15:50,814 --> 00:15:53,120
So, I know she does the 11 plus as well.

329
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:57,520
- She's doing some part of key stage
two or just the 11 plus because--

330
00:15:57,521 --> 00:16:00,240
- Oh, she's doing parts
of, yeah, well, yeah.

331
00:16:00,241 --> 00:16:01,080
I could ask her.

332
00:16:01,081 --> 00:16:02,231
I don't know, actually.

333
00:16:02,256 --> 00:16:07,760
I shouldn't really-- - Ideally, we
will not recommend the private tutors.

334
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:11,240
because that's something that
is in the home environment.

335
00:16:11,241 --> 00:16:14,760
And you will be in the home
environment with the children.

336
00:16:14,761 --> 00:16:17,600
But the children are outside
of the home environment.

337
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:22,120
Hence, when they go to school, that's
why we work better with school.

338
00:16:22,121 --> 00:16:23,240
- Right, okay, okay.

339
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,560
- Does that make sense?

340
00:16:24,561 --> 00:16:25,400
- No.

341
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,440
(laughing)

342
00:16:27,441 --> 00:16:31,720
- Okay, so, you are the one that employed--
- Oh, 'cause I employ them.

343
00:16:31,721 --> 00:16:33,080
- Yeah, you employed them.

344
00:16:33,081 --> 00:16:33,920
You're paying for them.

345
00:16:33,921 --> 00:16:36,160
- You can tell bitches that you wanted.

346
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,880
You wanted Nafi to pay half.

347
00:16:37,881 --> 00:16:39,360
(laughing)

348
00:16:39,361 --> 00:16:40,880
- I'm joking, I'm joking, I'm joking.

349
00:16:40,881 --> 00:16:41,720
- I'm staying out of that one.

350
00:16:41,721 --> 00:16:42,560
- I'm joking, joking, joking.

351
00:16:42,561 --> 00:16:43,400
No, no, no.

352
00:16:43,401 --> 00:16:44,240
That's just me joking.

353
00:16:44,241 --> 00:16:45,291
- Yeah, I understand.

354
00:16:45,292 --> 00:16:46,342
But that's the basis.

355
00:16:46,425 --> 00:16:48,000
So, school is independent.

356
00:16:48,001 --> 00:16:48,840
- Independent.

357
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,691
- And we work with independent--
- Independent people.

358
00:16:51,774 --> 00:16:52,320
- Yeah.

359
00:16:52,321 --> 00:16:53,160
- Oh, because I've been employed there.

360
00:16:53,161 --> 00:16:54,000
- So, the police is independent.

361
00:16:54,001 --> 00:16:54,951
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

362
00:16:55,034 --> 00:16:56,084
- I see, I see, okay.

363
00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:00,080
- So, the only person
that could come is Karen

364
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,680
with whom you're saying
is your support network.

365
00:17:02,763 --> 00:17:05,160
But that person is there to support you.

366
00:17:05,161 --> 00:17:06,000
- Right, okay.

367
00:17:06,001 --> 00:17:07,280
- Not for the children.

368
00:17:07,281 --> 00:17:09,160
- Right, oh, I see, I see.

369
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:11,880
- Right, so, that's why when
we did the scaling question

370
00:17:11,881 --> 00:17:15,527
in my meeting, I didn't ask her to scale
because it would have been inappropriate.

371
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:18,640
for her to scale on the situation of
your family because she's supporting you.

372
00:17:18,641 --> 00:17:19,480
- Yeah.

373
00:17:19,481 --> 00:17:21,080
- She would have probably
scaled to favor you.

374
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:23,360
Doesn't mean that she would, but
she would, you know what I mean?

375
00:17:23,361 --> 00:17:24,200
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it.

376
00:17:24,201 --> 00:17:27,640
So, it's that, so, that's
the, see, but then you see,

377
00:17:27,641 --> 00:17:31,440
it's like, it's so, nice
that you're able to, like,

378
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:36,321
like, so, if I've got a question,
you're able to articulate it

379
00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:39,760
and come back with a response
that kind of, like, tells

380
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:41,810
you, yeah, like, basically
they're not independent.

381
00:17:41,893 --> 00:17:45,393
So, like, you know, if they
did, or, you know, yeah.

382
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:46,680
Okay, that makes more sense.

383
00:17:46,681 --> 00:17:48,881
- But I like to talk
because I'm still here.

384
00:17:48,882 --> 00:17:49,721
- Yeah, same.

385
00:17:49,771 --> 00:17:56,160
But then, like, so, my, but then, like, you

386
00:17:56,161 --> 00:17:58,360
know, people that they
see on a regular basis,

387
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,560
I suppose they have their own
training and stuff, isn't it?

388
00:18:02,561 --> 00:18:03,400
- They will, I mean, they will.

389
00:18:03,401 --> 00:18:05,151
- So, maybe if they have gone, yeah.

390
00:18:05,152 --> 00:18:07,302
- The thing I just want
to consider is that

391
00:18:07,385 --> 00:18:12,367
because they see Oscar and Sienna at home,
they don't see them outside of the home.

392
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,600
- They see them outside
at their, at their.

393
00:18:14,683 --> 00:18:15,520
- At the school.

394
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:16,680
- Not the school, so.

395
00:18:16,681 --> 00:18:17,581
- At the facility.

396
00:18:17,582 --> 00:18:18,632
- Yeah, the facility.

397
00:18:18,715 --> 00:18:21,760
- So, they will have their own
safeguards in that school.

398
00:18:21,761 --> 00:18:22,600
- Okay.

399
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,440
- They are never really alone.

400
00:18:23,441 --> 00:18:26,400
They are with other people
within that facility.

401
00:18:26,401 --> 00:18:29,200
- And then they have,
yeah, so, with Judith,

402
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:35,520
they have, they see Judith at her
house and they see Simon at theirs.

403
00:18:35,521 --> 00:18:40,520
And then Ria and Dom, they
see in this Methodist church

404
00:18:40,521 --> 00:18:45,120
just over there, and that's
like their perform thing.

405
00:18:45,121 --> 00:18:48,121
And then tennis, like, you know,
it's not really one-to-one.

406
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:50,860
It's like with a whole
group and they're outside.

407
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:54,000
- If there was a, if there was something

408
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:56,250
that we're looking to get, so, for example,

409
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:58,800
because it can work
differently in the form of,

410
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:01,840
let's say, therapy, so, you
are seeking, you're seeking,

411
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,557
you're getting support for your
mental health with therapy.

412
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,132
and you wanted, you know, and
maybe it was a private therapist.

413
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,650
So, private therapists,
you often pay for that.

414
00:19:12,733 --> 00:19:14,833
We will not be inviting them to a meeting,

415
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:18,440
but we will seek where you
are in terms of your need.

416
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,640
You know, are you taking your medication?

417
00:19:20,641 --> 00:19:22,000
Are you having regular reviews?

418
00:19:22,001 --> 00:19:24,257
We don't need to find out
what you're discussing

419
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:27,923
'cause that's obviously doctor,
patient, privilege or whatever that is.

420
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,920
But we just wanna know that your
mental health is being supported.

421
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:31,971
Does that make sense?

422
00:19:32,054 --> 00:19:32,600
- Yeah.

423
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:37,440
- With this aspect of care, the
children are having additional lessons.

424
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:39,680
It's not anything that would be relevant

425
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,880
to safeguarding for them.

426
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:44,731
They can only give the opinion about,

427
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,783
okay, what they're special, okay,
Oscar is doing well in maths,

428
00:19:49,367 --> 00:19:50,200
Oscar is doing well in English,

429
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,150
Sienna is doing well in English,
you know, and vice versa.

430
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:56,200
But school can as well
give an indication of that

431
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:58,400
because that's their main base.

432
00:19:58,401 --> 00:19:59,880
This is extra tuition.

433
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,930
But at the same time,
you have to also, consider

434
00:20:03,013 --> 00:20:06,120
the other aspect that
should we be asking them

435
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:13,880
their opinion around what Richard is,
Richard might not really value us sharing

436
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:19,200
that part of his information
with somebody else that

437
00:20:19,201 --> 00:20:20,720
doesn't do anything else
other than tutor the children.

438
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:22,371
I don't know if that makes sense.

439
00:20:22,372 --> 00:20:25,122
But the school looks after
the tutoring of the children

440
00:20:25,205 --> 00:20:28,513
but they also, look after the
wellbeing of children as well.

441
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,320
Does that make sense?

442
00:20:30,321 --> 00:20:32,760
Like you are focused
on not really tutoring

443
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,971
but wellbeing of the children in the
home or you do homework with them.

444
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:39,840
So, some level of not tutoring
but some level of education work.

445
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:44,960
School does, the other-- - Constant education
at home, I tell you, it is constant.

446
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:45,800
- You tell it doesn't stop.

447
00:20:45,801 --> 00:20:47,601
- You know what we've started doing,

448
00:20:47,684 --> 00:20:50,280
they have this weighing
thing, oh my God, right?

449
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:53,120
So, now we weigh everything.

450
00:20:53,121 --> 00:20:55,720
We weigh the toast, the
bread in the morning.

451
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:58,771
I'm like, please, I need to put
the scales that are weighing.

452
00:20:58,854 --> 00:21:01,560
- You just drop something
out from them, that's it.

453
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:05,000
- He's like, oh, mummy, 47
grams for a slice of bread,

454
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:06,200
that's really light.

455
00:21:06,201 --> 00:21:09,960
I'm just like, well, just
put it in the toaster now.

456
00:21:09,961 --> 00:21:11,361
- So, you see the difference.

457
00:21:11,444 --> 00:21:14,720
So, they won't be able to
give any clear indication

458
00:21:14,721 --> 00:21:20,880
about how the children present
in the home because they

459
00:21:20,881 --> 00:21:22,120
don't really know anything
other than the learning.

460
00:21:22,121 --> 00:21:23,960
Or maybe they can say that.

461
00:21:23,961 --> 00:21:26,800
- So, the reason I say is
just because they spend

462
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:31,800
like one to one time, an hour,
about 45 minutes with them

463
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:36,080
and then, you know, and
even the other ones.

464
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,330
is like an hour and a half and stuff.

465
00:21:38,413 --> 00:21:40,332
But like, it's--.

466
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:45,320
- Don't get me wrong, if Oscar
made a disclosure to them,

467
00:21:45,321 --> 00:21:50,920
they have a duty of care to tell us
in terms of how they'll report it.

468
00:21:50,921 --> 00:21:53,280
And then, because it came from them,

469
00:21:53,281 --> 00:21:56,640
we would invite them to
the meeting at that point.

470
00:21:56,641 --> 00:21:58,600
But before that moment,

471
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:03,320
because we are having all the information
that we require in terms of from school--

472
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:06,720
- No, no, no, I think it's like,
I think, yeah, like you said,

473
00:22:06,721 --> 00:22:09,360
like school is independent,
police are independent,

474
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:11,640
you're independent,
everybody's independent.

475
00:22:11,641 --> 00:22:14,291
And then, you know, then
you're gonna have, you know,

476
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:20,000
I think questions could
be raised, like they're

477
00:22:20,025 --> 00:22:21,275
like paid tutors by you,
so, you're employing them.

478
00:22:21,358 --> 00:22:28,320
So, therefore, what they say may, could,
not that they, not that what they would say

479
00:22:28,321 --> 00:22:31,760
would be anything different
if they weren't independent.

480
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:37,720
Yeah, but like, I suppose if
you could raise a question

481
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,640
Mark over it, it's probably
just not a good thing then.

482
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:40,800
- Well, it wouldn't, yeah.

483
00:22:40,801 --> 00:22:42,880
- It makes, it makes, yeah, no, no, okay.

484
00:22:42,881 --> 00:22:45,600
- And I think the other
question then would be,

485
00:22:45,601 --> 00:22:48,240
if we're asking, because
with other people,

486
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:52,000
we have to ask them and they have to
be able to offer something in return.

487
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:54,387
So, like school, we are
saying, well, where are they?

488
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:56,170
Can you offer something in return?

489
00:22:56,253 --> 00:22:59,680
So, like Elsa support and all those
stuff like that, somebody is doing that.

490
00:22:59,681 --> 00:23:02,600
With your tutoring, they
wouldn't be able to offer that

491
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:04,880
because that eats into
their tutoring time.

492
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:09,320
So, then it becomes a therapy session as
opposed to actually just academic learning.

493
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:11,480
So, there isn't really like much, doesn't,

494
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:16,800
not in a bad way, but there's not really
much use for them other than the tutoring.

495
00:23:16,801 --> 00:23:18,280
- That's fine, okay.

496
00:23:18,281 --> 00:23:21,400
And like, so, I suppose I should ask CGC.

497
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:23,560
I don't know whether, so, like, you know,

498
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:28,360
just when you were talking,
so, I was thinking like CGC,

499
00:23:28,361 --> 00:23:30,811
if they haven't got, but
then in the court order,

500
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:35,920
it says CGC, I was just
thinking, like, do you know, like

501
00:23:35,921 --> 00:23:37,440
from now until, just to make
it easier for the children

502
00:23:37,441 --> 00:23:39,720
so, that they could have
it in the community,

503
00:23:39,721 --> 00:23:42,640
like locally rather
than going to, you know.

504
00:23:42,641 --> 00:23:43,880
- We can email them.

505
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:45,360
- Have you got, like, have you, no,

506
00:23:45,361 --> 00:23:47,840
have you got like supervisors
that you guys use?

507
00:23:47,841 --> 00:23:51,211
- Oh.
- Like a company, but it's just, I'm just thinking,

508
00:23:51,294 --> 00:23:54,640
I'm talking out loud now, but in
the court order, it does say CGC.

509
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:58,520
- We only use our contact centre.

510
00:23:58,521 --> 00:23:59,377
We do have a contact centre.

511
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,360
- But they don't have people that are

512
00:24:01,361 --> 00:24:02,911
employed there that do
that kind of stuff, no?

513
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:07,800
- We do, but only for cases
for us in our court arena,

514
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,480
not for private proceedings.

515
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:16,680
So, 'cause you've got private proceedings,
it wouldn't fall under our jurisdiction.

516
00:24:16,681 --> 00:24:19,400
We would not be able to
even comment on that.

517
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:21,680
- Oh, okay, that's fine, that's fine.

518
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:24,960
I just thought, like, so,
like the way I see it is,

519
00:24:24,961 --> 00:24:28,800
if CGC can't accommodate,
let's look at, like,

520
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:32,520
potentially a different
option that we could,

521
00:24:32,521 --> 00:24:34,560
like, just to make it
nicer for the children.

522
00:24:34,561 --> 00:24:36,600
Like, it is a bit of a mission,

523
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,640
like going all the way
up there and coming back,

524
00:24:38,641 --> 00:24:40,880
but then obviously, happy to
do it, don't get me wrong,

525
00:24:40,881 --> 00:24:44,480
but just like for the children, I think
it would just be nicer if it wasn't

526
00:24:44,481 --> 00:24:46,240
like a long drive there, a
long drive back sort of thing.

527
00:24:46,241 --> 00:24:48,591
- I think you might raise
it up again with them

528
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:51,730
and see if they can accommodate
somewhere a bit closer.

529
00:24:51,813 --> 00:24:55,040
- I'll find that thing with
the, with the price of it.

530
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:58,080
- And double check the cost
as well, so, that they're

531
00:24:58,081 --> 00:25:00,280
not gonna say, oh no, because
you only paid 80 pounds,

532
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,930
you have to bring the
child to Basingstoke,

533
00:25:03,013 --> 00:25:05,400
and then you know for sure that actually,

534
00:25:05,401 --> 00:25:07,640
that's the reason why
you're going to Basingstoke.

535
00:25:07,641 --> 00:25:09,441
But just get some clarity from them.

536
00:25:09,524 --> 00:25:12,483
- Yeah, but you know, it
clearly states that it was,

537
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,247
I don't know, it's just
sometimes you just think,

538
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:20,400
people have been doing it for so, long,
like now I really wish it had said,

539
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:27,240
but then actually that was
it, yes, I know, I remember

540
00:25:27,241 --> 00:25:31,640
now, because in the last,
what do you call it?

541
00:25:31,641 --> 00:25:39,920
When we were at court, there was that, in
the, I don't, it wasn't in my statement,

542
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,080
it was something else, yeah?

543
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:45,920
So, basically saying that
perhaps Richard might wanna,

544
00:25:45,921 --> 00:25:51,840
like I suggested things to do, because
they'd only been going to the arcade,

545
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:58,200
and they'd gone to golf at the arcade,
and so, I just wrote down to be helpful,

546
00:25:58,201 --> 00:26:01,200
like they could go to Windsor
Castle, go on the duck tours,

547
00:26:01,201 --> 00:26:08,280
they could go chocolate making,
they could go ape, and made

548
00:26:08,281 --> 00:26:12,080
suggestions like that, in and
around here, what they could do.

549
00:26:13,127 --> 00:26:23,440
And then, and then, yeah.

550
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:24,920
- Sorry, I'm not in that.

551
00:26:24,921 --> 00:26:29,881
- I'm just thinking that like, yeah,
'cause I made the suggestion saying,

552
00:26:29,882 --> 00:26:32,782
these are the things that you
could do in and around here,

553
00:26:32,865 --> 00:26:37,241
so, I'm just, so, what my thing is,
like I wish like in the court order,

554
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:39,360
it'd been more specific about,

555
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:44,040
the supervision has to be,

556
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:49,080
like more here, or easier
for the children to get to,

557
00:26:49,081 --> 00:26:53,040
rather than me having to go to
Basingstoke, Basingstoke was

558
00:26:53,041 --> 00:26:55,320
only supposed to be, if the
supervisor couldn't come here.

559
00:26:55,321 --> 00:27:00,880
So, but then it's not, reading through
it, it's not really stipulated that well,

560
00:27:01,005 --> 00:27:03,920
but now I kind of, yeah.

561
00:27:03,921 --> 00:27:05,871
- I think maybe this is something that,

562
00:27:05,954 --> 00:27:08,513
like you say, you've reflected
on in hindsight,

563
00:27:09,207 --> 00:27:10,880
is maybe if you did go back to
court, you would have to bring,

564
00:27:10,881 --> 00:27:13,960
did you represent yourself,
or did you let a solicitor?

565
00:27:13,961 --> 00:27:17,160
So, then maybe you want to bring it to
the attention next time or something,

566
00:27:17,161 --> 00:27:19,348
hopefully it doesn't, we
don't know what it's gonna be,

567
00:27:19,431 --> 00:27:22,830
but if that was ever a case then,
because then you'll be saying,

568
00:27:22,913 --> 00:27:26,360
for future you would like contact
to kind of, be in this area anyway.

569
00:27:26,361 --> 00:27:29,000
- Yeah, but then I remember
him saying, 'cause he was like,

570
00:27:29,001 --> 00:27:31,720
that's really controlling, she's been
controlling, she's been controlling,

571
00:27:31,721 --> 00:27:33,960
and I was like, actually
I'm just trying to be helpful

572
00:27:33,961 --> 00:27:37,027
and give suggestions that would be things
that the children might like to do,

573
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:41,800
that would be a bit more
child focused, but if you

574
00:27:41,801 --> 00:27:44,480
feel that it's controlling,
like, you know, it's like,

575
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:48,440
I can't take anything
about it, then can I?

576
00:27:48,441 --> 00:27:50,641
'Cause I genuinely just
trying to be helpful

577
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,480
and find things that the
children might want to do

578
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:57,120
that you might not have thought
about, but yeah, anyway.

579
00:27:57,121 --> 00:28:01,120
- But that's-- - And then I
think I was so, focused on being,

580
00:28:01,121 --> 00:28:03,271
don't be controlling,
don't be controlling,

581
00:28:03,354 --> 00:28:08,880
like he thinks you're being controlling,
that I suppose I didn't like--

582
00:28:08,881 --> 00:28:09,720
- Pay attention to the other stuff.

583
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:14,000
- Pay attention to the other stuff
and just let it, and was just

584
00:28:14,001 --> 00:28:16,840
like, right, okay, I don't want
to appear as controlling, so.

585
00:28:16,841 --> 00:28:19,800
- Is that, so, in terms of the journey,

586
00:28:19,801 --> 00:28:22,251
I think this could be a
reflection point as well,

587
00:28:22,334 --> 00:28:24,904
you could maybe explain
what the journey is.

588
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:28,840
to the solicitor at the time, to say
it's 40 minutes to go, 40 minutes to come.

589
00:28:28,841 --> 00:28:31,400
Sometimes, you know, I don't
know what the journey is.

590
00:28:31,401 --> 00:28:34,800
- But even like getting the children
downstairs, come on then, let's go,

591
00:28:34,801 --> 00:28:37,161
right, get your shoes on,
get this on, da-da-da-da-da,

592
00:28:37,244 --> 00:28:40,850
just that whole even getting ready
before you even get out the door

593
00:28:40,933 --> 00:28:44,080
is like, you know, a good like
15 minutes, 20 minutes as well,

594
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,131
so, door to door, like, you know,
from the minute you start saying,

595
00:28:48,214 --> 00:28:51,520
come on, we have to go now, come
on, come on, get your shoes on,

596
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:54,600
fifth time, come on, get your
shoes on, then you relax.

597
00:28:54,601 --> 00:28:58,640
- Definitely, it's definitely,
yeah, it's worth

598
00:28:58,641 --> 00:29:00,520
exploring, I'm sorry, I'm going
to have to make my way.

599
00:29:00,521 --> 00:29:03,000
- No, I get it, no,
that's fine, thank you.

600
00:29:03,001 --> 00:29:08,640
- I hope that was okay for you, if I
sort of answered the other sort of stuff.

601
00:29:08,641 --> 00:29:11,591
- That makes, yeah, it all
makes, makes a lot more sense.

602
00:29:11,674 --> 00:29:13,320
- Sort of begin the work.

603
00:29:13,321 --> 00:29:20,160
So, my colleagues should be in touch
in terms of doing some keep safe work,

604
00:29:20,161 --> 00:29:26,000
I know, right, I'm just awful
at this, keep safe work,

605
00:29:26,001 --> 00:29:26,840
I just speak more slowly,
that will probably help.

606
00:29:26,841 --> 00:29:31,200
- Look, I'll show you some things that
the children did, this is like over the,

607
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:34,680
this was the last holiday,
not the holidays just now, but

608
00:29:34,681 --> 00:29:36,360
they went to get, Sienna had
her birthday party on Sunday.

609
00:29:36,361 --> 00:29:37,960
- Oh, happy birthday, Sienna.

610
00:29:37,961 --> 00:29:41,520
- But this isn't her birthday party,
this was Theo's birthday party,

611
00:29:41,521 --> 00:29:43,972
and she got the idea from,
look how high they are.

612
00:29:44,055 --> 00:29:44,888
- Oh, wow.

613
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:47,600
- That's like 25, 20 meters or something.

614
00:29:47,601 --> 00:29:48,480
- Wow, that's lovely.

615
00:29:48,481 --> 00:29:51,200
- Really high, we went to see the crown
jewels, they took this book into--

616
00:29:51,201 --> 00:29:52,440
- Where was this, in London?

617
00:29:52,441 --> 00:29:56,181
- Yeah, the crown jewels, the Tower of
London, so, that's, we took them there,

618
00:29:56,231 --> 00:29:59,680
then they wrote like, you know,
I saw the crown that King Charles

619
00:29:59,681 --> 00:30:03,120
is going to wear on the coronation,
so, we actually saw that crown,

620
00:30:03,121 --> 00:30:05,920
and Oscar actually traced that, the
tracing paper, how cool is that?

621
00:30:05,921 --> 00:30:06,760
- Very nice.

622
00:30:06,761 --> 00:30:07,611
- Good, isn't it?

623
00:30:07,694 --> 00:30:08,533
- Very nice.

624
00:30:08,767 --> 00:30:11,480
- And my favorite crown was the
tiny one, made for Queen Victoria.

625
00:30:11,481 --> 00:30:12,320
- Oh, wow.

626
00:30:12,321 --> 00:30:13,221
- So, she was like,

627
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:17,560
and then we seen Queen Victoria's crown,
there's a picture of her, where am I?

628
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:21,200
- They look like they had so, much
fun when they had the outing.

629
00:30:21,201 --> 00:30:23,501
- Yeah, and then they had, you know this,

630
00:30:23,551 --> 00:30:27,560
this ring, they showed it in
the coronation, and this ring.

631
00:30:27,561 --> 00:30:28,400
- Okay.

632
00:30:28,401 --> 00:30:29,651
- And this was the crown.

633
00:30:29,734 --> 00:30:32,600
Then we went to, that's my mum.

634
00:30:32,601 --> 00:30:34,720
We went to see, we saw
the soldiers and stuff.

635
00:30:34,721 --> 00:30:36,000
- Does she live around here?

636
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:38,520
- No, just Hayes, just
down the road, not too far.

637
00:30:38,521 --> 00:30:41,831
And then we went to see,
oh, we just went round,

638
00:30:41,914 --> 00:30:44,320
and saw pictures of the
coronation and stuff.

639
00:30:44,321 --> 00:30:48,551
And they'd see, when they saw the police
on horses, they thought that was amazing.

640
00:30:48,552 --> 00:30:50,320
Went on cable cars.

641
00:30:50,321 --> 00:30:51,160
- Yeah.

642
00:30:51,161 --> 00:30:53,691
- That was really good, that
was at the O2, that was amazing.

643
00:30:53,774 --> 00:30:54,520
- Very nice.

644
00:30:54,521 --> 00:30:57,280
- Went to a birthday party,
and then when kids see

645
00:30:57,281 --> 00:30:58,960
like butterflies and
stuff, they really love it.

646
00:30:58,961 --> 00:31:03,760
And then, yeah, went to Southampton
Marina with some other friends.

647
00:31:03,761 --> 00:31:05,261
They thought this was amazing.

648
00:31:05,344 --> 00:31:06,040
- Yeah.

649
00:31:06,041 --> 00:31:06,880
- Saw the deer.

650
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:10,560
- And when the deer was crossing the road.

651
00:31:10,561 --> 00:31:14,560
- They thought it was so, I was so
happy, I could not believe my eyes.

652
00:31:14,561 --> 00:31:15,400
- No.

653
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,840
- At Sienna.

654
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:19,861
I saw the deer crossing,
and crossing the road.

655
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:23,160
It was the most wonderful sight,
and the best experience of my life.

656
00:31:23,161 --> 00:31:24,000
- Oh my goodness.

657
00:31:24,001 --> 00:31:25,752
- And I was like, that's in my life.

658
00:31:25,835 --> 00:31:26,668
- Ah.

659
00:31:26,845 --> 00:31:27,995
- Everything's my life.

660
00:31:28,078 --> 00:31:29,877
I went clip and climb,

661
00:31:30,087 --> 00:31:31,687
I think it was a birthday party.

662
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:33,480
Amelia's seventh birthday party.

663
00:31:33,481 --> 00:31:34,560
Went to Bushy Park.

664
00:31:34,561 --> 00:31:35,711
This, how cute is this?

665
00:31:35,794 --> 00:31:41,160
Look, I went to Bushy
Park, I saw brown bark,

666
00:31:41,161 --> 00:31:42,720
I saw some deer, there's nothing to fear.

667
00:31:42,721 --> 00:31:44,440
I went in the sand,

668
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:46,440
and it was squidgy land.

669
00:31:46,441 --> 00:31:48,200
- Oh, very good rhyme.

670
00:31:48,201 --> 00:31:49,151
- How cute is that?

671
00:31:49,234 --> 00:31:50,120
- What a poet.

672
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,440
- So, sweet.

673
00:31:51,441 --> 00:31:54,800
And then like, they made these, they
haven't written that out, their bits,

674
00:31:54,801 --> 00:31:58,374
but they made these, a flamingo and
this, and you have to put the beads in,

675
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,160
and do those things.

676
00:32:00,161 --> 00:32:01,000
- Very nice.

677
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,137
- And I thought those bubbles were nice.

678
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:06,960
Sienna's class is Hadid class,
and this lady, Zahra Hadid,

679
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,000
she builds like curvy buildings.

680
00:32:09,001 --> 00:32:09,840
- Oh right.

681
00:32:09,841 --> 00:32:11,320
- So.

682
00:32:11,321 --> 00:32:14,080
- So, it looks like you had
lots, lots of fun activities.

683
00:32:14,081 --> 00:32:14,920
- Yes.

684
00:32:14,921 --> 00:32:18,480
I ran out of printing ink.

685
00:32:18,481 --> 00:32:19,640
- For the picture.

686
00:32:19,641 --> 00:32:22,920
- For the, no, not ink, the paper.

687
00:32:22,921 --> 00:32:24,821
So, I've got some more paper and stuff.

688
00:32:24,904 --> 00:32:25,600
So, Richard.

689
00:32:25,601 --> 00:32:26,440
- The Little Mermaid.

690
00:32:26,441 --> 00:32:27,640
- Oh, it's really good.

691
00:32:27,641 --> 00:32:28,491
Have you seen it?

692
00:32:28,541 --> 00:32:29,331
- Yeah, I went to see it.

693
00:32:29,332 --> 00:32:31,800
- Oh, so, nice, isn't it?

694
00:32:31,801 --> 00:32:35,920
And Richard got these magazines, the week.

695
00:32:35,921 --> 00:32:36,760
- Life Savers.

696
00:32:36,761 --> 00:32:37,840
- Juniors.

697
00:32:37,841 --> 00:32:38,680
- Very nice.

698
00:32:38,681 --> 00:32:43,200
- So, they didn't ask
me what vaping was, I

699
00:32:43,201 --> 00:32:44,440
said, "Never you mind,
"read the other bits."

700
00:32:44,441 --> 00:32:46,840
(laughing)

701
00:32:46,841 --> 00:32:50,156
- That's funny, but you know what,
that's them being inquisitive.

702
00:32:50,239 --> 00:32:50,680
- Yeah.

703
00:32:50,681 --> 00:32:51,520
- So.

704
00:32:51,521 --> 00:32:52,360
- Yeah.

705
00:32:52,361 --> 00:32:54,960
- And I'll definitely have more and
more questions for you as time goes on.

706
00:32:54,961 --> 00:32:55,800
- Yeah.

707
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,720
- So, I think,

708
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,880
teach them everything in moderation.

709
00:32:59,881 --> 00:33:00,720
- Yeah.

710
00:33:00,721 --> 00:33:04,720
What's the, when's our next, so, is our
next, are you coming to see the children?

711
00:33:04,721 --> 00:33:05,560
- Yes, I'm coming, I think.

712
00:33:05,561 --> 00:33:06,520
- Is it next week?

713
00:33:06,521 --> 00:33:07,360
- I think next week, yeah.

714
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:08,660
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

715
00:33:08,661 --> 00:33:10,361
- And I'll do some work with them.

716
00:33:10,444 --> 00:33:11,000
- Okay.

717
00:33:11,001 --> 00:33:13,451
- Around what we've been
discussing this Tuesday.

718
00:33:13,534 --> 00:33:17,480
Keep safe, what, my goodness,
like I can't help myself, can I?

719
00:33:17,481 --> 00:33:21,240
So, keep safe work, we'll
do some work around that.

720
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:26,360
And then, somebody in my team is gonna
come and do some work with you around,

721
00:33:26,361 --> 00:33:29,280
you know, what are the
signs, what to expect,

722
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,800
and then some more keep safe work.

723
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:34,541
And when I, yeah, I know
I got it right this time.

724
00:33:34,624 --> 00:33:39,640
And when we eventually
sort of step away from your

725
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:43,280
family's lives, then you can
continue that keep safe work.

726
00:33:43,281 --> 00:33:45,560
And there will be some resources as well.

727
00:33:45,561 --> 00:33:49,520
So, resources meaning like places
you can explore or look online.

728
00:33:49,521 --> 00:33:50,360
- Yeah.

729
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:51,200
- Around,

730
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:53,280
and tailoring it to their age.

731
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:54,120
- Yeah.

732
00:33:54,121 --> 00:33:57,160
- So, right now, we can't
all obviously talk so

733
00:33:57,161 --> 00:33:59,057
explicitly about sex and
all the stuff like that.

734
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:02,240
But we can obviously do
little things about, okay,

735
00:34:02,241 --> 00:34:04,263
when they touch you, this is
just face, you can say no,

736
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,440
all those kind of things like that.

737
00:34:06,441 --> 00:34:09,320
If you've got a safe
person to talk to, you talk

738
00:34:09,321 --> 00:34:11,360
to mommy, you talk to
the teachers at school,

739
00:34:12,047 --> 00:34:14,631
you can talk to auntie,
you've got your worry bear,

740
00:34:15,207 --> 00:34:16,040
and there's a thing that
we'll show them as well.

741
00:34:16,041 --> 00:34:19,600
Or you've got, it doesn't have to be, it
doesn't really have to be a worry bear.

742
00:34:19,601 --> 00:34:24,400
It can just be, you can write a
letter, you know, or like a diary.

743
00:34:24,401 --> 00:34:28,360
And you can sort of, you know,
I don't know whether you get

744
00:34:28,361 --> 00:34:31,840
like a little, made out of a
cardboard, and can post it.

745
00:34:31,841 --> 00:34:32,680
- Yeah.

746
00:34:32,681 --> 00:34:35,320
- And forget the worries, you post
it, and later you can read it.

747
00:34:35,321 --> 00:34:37,022
So, it's a very fun activity to do.

748
00:34:37,105 --> 00:34:37,720
- Yeah.

749
00:34:37,721 --> 00:34:40,240
- If you can, or even like a
shoe box, like a memory box.

750
00:34:40,241 --> 00:34:42,760
You can keep a shoe box, you can
write like a little note in there.

751
00:34:42,761 --> 00:34:45,240
You don't really have to
physically go and buy worry bear.

752
00:34:45,241 --> 00:34:46,080
- Yeah.

753
00:34:46,081 --> 00:34:49,440
- 'Cause that, I am-- - Now, what
we've got is-- - My mom's house.

754
00:34:49,441 --> 00:34:51,120
- Remember when I said--
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

755
00:34:51,121 --> 00:34:53,061
- It was like, mommy it doesn't work.

756
00:34:53,144 --> 00:34:53,640
- Yeah.

757
00:34:53,641 --> 00:34:54,480
- Yeah, alright.

758
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:58,520
- A shoe box, you can
fold it up, and put it

759
00:34:58,521 --> 00:34:59,520
in a shoe box and stuff,
and read it later.

760
00:34:59,521 --> 00:35:02,480
- Okay, so, just, I just
said that, so, I think,

761
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,040
I think these hand balloons
from the party, I've just,

762
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:08,400
they're sort of dwindling, but
I just put them there for like,

763
00:35:08,401 --> 00:35:12,440
you know they just like to see them,
until they're just like, sorry we digress.

764
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:16,560
So, yeah, so, I think you're seeing them
next week, I'm sure it's in my diary.

765
00:35:16,561 --> 00:35:19,480
And then somebody else has
got to contact me, yeah?

766
00:35:19,481 --> 00:35:20,320
- Yeah, come from my team.

767
00:35:20,321 --> 00:35:21,160
- That's fine.

768
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,691
- If not, I will do some work
anyway, before she comes,

769
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,627
she's our practice social, not social,
she's our practice assistant in our team,

770
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:31,001
so, she's not a social worker, but
she's like a practice assistant,

771
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:33,481
so, she's supporting social workers,

772
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:37,057
because as you can understand, we have
other, other families that we support.

773
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,280
- Yeah, so, something that you could, yeah.

774
00:35:39,281 --> 00:35:40,120
- So,

775
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:44,003
- Yeah, to lighten your load,
but you know what I mean, yeah,

776
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,480
so, to do the stuff that,
they don't, that you can,

777
00:35:48,481 --> 00:35:49,320
- Yeah, so, I could do
the work, but I wouldn't,

778
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:51,280
I wouldn't give you all
that time that you need,

779
00:35:51,281 --> 00:35:53,640
like all the attention that
you need, so, like right now,

780
00:35:53,641 --> 00:35:56,280
I can come maybe once a week,
but she can even do every day,

781
00:35:56,281 --> 00:35:59,320
that kind of thing like that, so
we'll just sort of work on the plan,

782
00:35:59,321 --> 00:36:03,760
and she will contact you at some point,
and yeah, - Okay, good, all right,

783
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:05,240
then I'm gonna write that
email to Claire again.

784
00:36:05,241 --> 00:36:09,040
- Oh yeah, and if you can email
me your network support, and then,

785
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:11,880
the people that want to be, and then I can
sort of have, we can have that meeting,

786
00:36:11,881 --> 00:36:16,040
if we work best, we can do it on
Teams, or we can do it at your home,

787
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:19,920
everybody will be here, if they
can't be here, I can come here

788
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:21,720
and be with you, - So, you're gonna
do this before October?

789
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:25,280
- Yeah, before October, whilst
we're still, so, we can discuss what,

790
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:28,560
so, like you said, your sisters
were having some questions,

791
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:30,711
but you didn't know
what that would entail,

792
00:36:31,727 --> 00:36:34,461
so, we can at least have their viewpoints,
about what their commitments would be,

793
00:36:34,462 --> 00:36:39,480
and what that would look like, to
understand what it could entail,

794
00:36:39,481 --> 00:36:42,800
and then come October, you
can present it and say,

795
00:36:42,801 --> 00:36:46,320
well this is my side of the
list, and Richard will have his

796
00:36:46,321 --> 00:36:48,000
side of the list, and then
we can kind of work that way.

797
00:36:48,001 --> 00:36:52,200
- Fantastic, so, that's what
you can do, perfect, okay, bye.
